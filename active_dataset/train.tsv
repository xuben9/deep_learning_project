0	0	a	Software Requirements Specification for the System Administration of an Integrated Library System 1.1 Purpose and Perspective
1	0	a	This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the System Administration Module of an Integrated Library System (ILS).
2	0	a	The System Administration Module facilitates the management of every aspect of the Integrated Library System.
3	0	a	Backing up databases, configuration files, log files, etc.
4	0	a	The current specification presupposes the general functionality of an ILS and specifies only those requirements that directly or indirectly relate to management activities.
5	0	a	King County Library has previously published specifications for Acquisitions and Serials Management, Circulation, and Cataloging modules.
6	0	a	Requirements for OPAC and web services are currently under development.
7	0	a	Moreover, the current specification is focused on functional characteristics of System Administration.
8	0	a	Data structures and user interfaces will require further specification and development using an iterative, prototype-oriented software development methodology. 1.3 Intended Audience
9	0	a	This SRS is intended both for library managers and staff who may contribute additional requirements or commentary, and for software project managers and developers who will implement the requirements.
10	0	a	As such, it aims for a high level of readability for a non-technical audience, while providing enough specificity to be useful to a software developer.
11	0	a	It is assumed that when software development occurs, it will be in a highly collaborative and iterative environment in which end-users have multiple opportunities to review prototypes and refine the user interface and software functionality.
12	0	a	It is also assumed that the reader has a general understanding of Library services and processes and does not require definition of common Library terminology. 1.4 Document Conventions

196	0	a	This section provides a general overview of the system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.
197	0	a	The program is focused on demonstration and assessment of data transformation and management, and DUAP system development is a means to that end.
198	0	a	From a systems engineering functional viewpoint, the DUAP system has four high-level capabilities: ? Collecting data ?
199	0	a	Converting data into information needed by transportation agencies ? Communicating the unified information to various agencies and the public
200	0	a	Each representation has its own strengths and limitations, but all are intended to create understanding of the system?s boundaries, components, and interactions.
201	0	a	Each representation has its own set of basic units and interactions.
202	0	a	One or more of these representations taken together describe the system architecture. Systems similar to the DUAP system are frequently and effectively represented as sets of interacting services.
203	0	a	Each service has one or more interfaces by which the services interact.
204	0	a	This representation is a very natural way of approaching a potentially complex system with a basic repeatable model.
205	1	a	A representation based on services and interfaces inherently leads to a flexible, scalable, and maintainable design.
206	1	a	A DUAP system based on a service-oriented architecture will then be flexible, scalable, and maintainable.
207	1	a	It will be capable of handling large amounts of continuously streaming data.
208	0	a	As shown in the figure, the basic services provided by DUAP are input, dynamic data, computational, persistent data, output, presentation, and administrative.
209	0	a	The VII Proof of Concept (POC) input service, for example, will use the X-031 Probe Data Service interface as described by the VII Network
210	0	a	User to Service Delivery Node (SDN) Subsystem document.
211	1	a	DUAP data input services will send a subscription request to the Probe Data Service, to be fulfilled within the VII network.
212	0	a	As infrastructure data are collected from the vehicles by the network, the network feeds the data continuously to the subscribed DUAP services. (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration.
213	1	a	2006.) Data available to input services will vary among sources.
214	1	a	Input services will also receive speed, volume, and occupancy data from ATMS throughout the state.
215	1	a	Archive services will store data from the dynamic data services to support future data analysis and management needs.
216	1	a	Checking 2.2.5 Output Services Output services subscribe to analyzed data and format it for use by other services both within the DUAP system and external to it.
217	1	a	This could be as simple as structuring data for presentation as a report on a DUAP Web page.
218	1	a	It could also build informative messages to be sent to VII-participating vehicles.
219	1	a	Due to the inherent flexibility in modular service implementation, presentation services?and the data output services that support those presentation services?can be added to the system as needed.
220	1	a	A presentation service, however, would create the user interface.
221	1	a	Essentially, administrative services fulfill the role of ?meta-services.?
222	0	a	The Director of the Michigan Department of Transportation is appointed by the Governor.
223	0	a	The Executive Bureau also includes a Chief Deputy Director, Chief Administrative Officer, and Chief Operations Officer.
224	0	a	The Michigan State Transportation Commission is the policy-making body for all state transportation programs.
225	0	a	The Commission consists of a six-member bi- partisan board appointed by the governor of Michigan with the advice and consent of the State Senate.
226	0	a	The Asset Management Council has a goal to expand the practice of asset management statewide in order to more efficiently invest in Michigan?s roads and bridges.
227	1	a	The gathered information must be presented to all users in ?real-time?, meaning that the information is only valuable if it can be provided and acted upon quickly enough to reduce the impact of the event as it is occurring.
228	1	a	The information also needs to be accurate. Transportation agency (TA) Operators include local, regional, and state transportation agencies throughout Michigan, and in adjoining jurisdictions.
229	1	a	These operators have one common objective, which is to minimize the impact of incidents and events on the normal flow of traffic.
230	1	a	These contractors will work with the agency staff to meet the requirements of their contract. Travelers are all the people who use the roadways, whether driving or riding in private or commercial vehicles.
231	1	a	They obtain their trip information from various sources and use it to prepare for their daily commute or for an extended trip.
232	1	a	The trip information may be used by the traveler for determining possible delays along desired route(s) or choosing an alternative route or mode of transportation.
233	1	a	Emergency services are staffed with trained personnel who respond to emergency incidents or major disasters both on and off the roadway system.
234	1	a	Their primary goal is to protect themselves and the public during the response to an incident. The data from the roadway system will assist them initially in getting to the incident location.
235	0	a	The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) is an example of one such group.
236	0	a	It has worked with the Michigan State Police Office of Highway Safety on crash investigation research.
237	1	a	It is important that the data used by the researchers is accurate and complete.
238	0	a	The Michigan Transportation Research Board (MTRB) is led by MDOT and is a voluntary advisory body to Michigan?s transportation agencies.
239	1	a	MTRB will assist in the following: ? Identifying and prioritizing transportation research needs ? Interacting with other organizations that conduct and support research ?
240	0	a	Advocating the value of research to improve Michigan?s transportation system ?
241	0	a	The intent of adding new data sources is to provide a more complete dataset upon which the transportation agencies can base operational decisions, but there are not necessarily any new users of VII data within the agencies.
242	1	a	The providers of VII data are, however, new stakeholders in transportation operations.
243	1	a	Once the VII field infrastructure is in place, a network operating entity will be needed to operate, monitor, and maintain the flow of VII data and the infrastructure enabling it.
244	0	a	The operating entity?s responsibilities in this capacity are similar to those of a transportation agency relative to the transportation network. 2.4 General Constraints
245	1	a	In its prototype DUAP applications, MDOT will be evaluating a broad range of data uses and analyses.
246	0	a	Some of these evaluations will benefit from being able to link probe vehicle data directly to information about the vehicles on which the data originates.
247	1	a	While this ability is of tremendous value in application research, operational policies will need to be established to protect the privacy and data ownership of the data originators.
248	0	a	While the USDOT VII program is addressing policy issues for the VII network itself, MDOT will be faced with many of the same issues as it seeks to integrate VII data into its operations.
249	0	a	VII probe data is ?anonymized? to the extent that it is not associated directly with a particular vehicle or driver, there are inherent limitations to that anonymity.
250	0	a	In the simplest such case, the VII-originated record of a vehicle?s behavior could be uniquely correlated to a particular vehicle if it were the only such vehicle on a roadway at a particular time and corroborated by other observations.
251	0	a	While the bulk of data will be from the VII network, other sources present opportunities for data expansion and validation that might be necessary for DUAP to succeed.
252	0	a	Latency enters into the data collection process in several ways: ?
253	0	a	The time required for vehicle systems to collect and store vehicle data ?
254	0	a	The delay between the data collection and the data transmission from the vehicle to the roadside equipment (RSE) ?
255	0	a	The time required for the transmission of data from the RSE to the DUAP system ?
256	1	a	Each application using the VII and DUAP data will need to have the capability of assessing the quality of data and making appropriate use of any available data quality flags.
257	0	a	While these factors can be controlled during the evaluation phase of this project, only the number of RSE locations will be within the control of agencies during the full production roll-out of the system. 3 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

384	0	a	Functional Requirements Specification for the Model Manager This document defines the functional or high-lever user requirements for the Model Manager software tool.
385	0	a	It describes the main functionality of the tool from the user's perspective.
386	0	a	This document will serve as input for a potential Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) document.
387	0	a	1.4 Project Scope The Model Manager is a software tool that will allow the user to configure, schedule, run, monitor, and stop (and re-start /resume) model jobs.
388	0	a	The primary goal of this project is to extend the current model back end system and to automate the setup, running and monitoring of model jobs.
389	0	a	This will include a more automated node management system.
390	0	a	Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective With the increase in NSAP projects, staff and hardware, a more automated and procedural, and in some cases, easier way of setting up and running a model job has become necessary.
391	0	a	The MM will provide this extension and enhancement to the current model back end.
392	0	a	The MM is a stand- alone software tool, which will also be part of the 4DWX OTM system (see [1]).
393	1	a	The MM can run in conjunction with the MetVault, and it can also run as a stand-alone application with no knowledge about a MetVault.
394	1	a	The MM will be accessible from a web-based GUI and a command line tool.
395	0	a	2.2 Product Features The main functions of the system are described in the diagram below.
396	1	a	Users of the system will be able to: There are three main user classes of the system.
397	0	a	First, scientists and software engineers at NSAP, who will be using the system for setting up and maintaining operational model runs.
398	0	a	These are users who are experienced and familiar with the model back end.
399	0	a	A second group of users consists of scientists at RAL (and also outside of RAL), who will be using the system for running model jobs for research purposes.
400	0	a	Users in this group may want to setup and run customized model jobs, e.g., provide their own input data and own input data processors.
401	0	a	A third group consists of users who are less familiar with model setups.
402	0	a	Users in this group might want view the status of operational model runs, stop and restart existing jobs or set up and start a 'standard' model job.
403	0	a	System Features This chapter describes the use cases for the MM in more detail.
404	1	a	The MM will manage jobs on one or more clusters.
405	1	a	Node allocation, management and utilization will be provided by the MM (SRS note: The MM provides centralized control over a collection of clusters.).
406	1	a	For a user, this has the following implications: A user may not want or need to know how many and which clusters a MM is managing.
407	1	a	S/he will submit a job to the MM and the MM will make the decision on what cluster(s) the job will be running.
408	1	a	On the other hand, a user might need to submit customized jobs to a specific cluster.
409	1	a	In this case, the user will need to have the option to specify what cluster his/her job should run on.
410	0	a	Managing more than one cluster, will also allow RTFDDA and climoFDDA ensembles to run across several clusters.
411	1	a	? The user can submit a job by supplying a job configuration file to the MM (3.4).

1179	0	a	# Assumption 1 The NLM Collection Development Policy defines the scope of the NLM Digital Repository.
1180	1	a	2 A primary goal of the conversion of content for the repository is the preservation of the content.
1181	0	a	Priority will be given to preserving the intellectual content.
1182	0	a	"The preservation of the original ""look and feel"" of the original source will be considered and reviewed on a case by case basis."
1183	1	a	3 NLM originals will be kept in the collection after digitization.
1184	1	a	4 NLM will not provide or maintain special software required to access materials in the NLM Digital Repository (e.g., for audiovisuals or computer applications).
1185	1	a	5 The NLM Digital Repository will contain materials digitized by NLM and born-digital materials created or acquired by NLM.
1186	1	a	6 NLM will undertake a distributed custodial model for some digital materials.
1187	0	a	Not all digital objects will be stored in the NLM Digital Repository, but the metadata for those objects will be stored in an NLM-managed system, such as the Integrated Library System (ILS).
1188	0	a	7 At a minimum, the original normalized object, the most recent migrated version and the next-to-the-last migrated version will be kept.
1189	0	a	Other intermediary versions may be discarded, and in some cases all versions may need to be retained.
1190	1	a	8 All digital objects must have an NLM unique internal identifier (UID).
1191	1	a	9 The system design and architecture should minimize duplicate data entry of any metadata for objects in the NLM Digital Repository.
1192	1	a	10 Master images and descriptive/structural/administrative metadata that meet NLM?s specifications are created for all digital content that is produced from NLM analog collections and intended for permanent retention.
1193	1	a	11 The NLM Digital Repository will contain objects of varying levels of permanence, including ones that will not be permanently retained.
1194	0	a	NLM will assign permanence ratings to objects stored in the NLM Digital Repository.
1195	1	a	12 The Repository must support the use of multiple languages and non-Roman scripts for ingest, maintenance and access of digital objects and associated metadata.
1196	0	a	13 Web harvesting functionality is outside the scope of the Digital Repository requirements.
1197	1	a	NLM expects to use separate software for web harvesting.
1198	1	a	Harvested data/web pages will be stored in the repository.
1199	1	a	14 The NLM Digital Repository will not be a dark archive.
1200	0	a	Objects in the repository will be available for use, although access to specific objects may be restricted to on-site use or for a set period of time due to embargo.
1201	1	a	15 The Repository system must follow HHS/NIH standards concerning software and systems security.
1202	1	a	16 To the extent possible, automation should be used for the extraction of descriptive and technical metadata.
1203	0	a	It is intended primarily as a working document for NLM staff and defines the range of subjects to be acquired and the extent of the Library's collecting effort within these subjects.
1204	0	a	It also addresses selection issues presented by a range of formats and literature types.
1205	0	a	The CDM is based on the Collection Development Policy adopted by the NLM Board of Regents in 1976 and amended in 1983 and 1992.
1206	0	a	The goals of NLM?s digitization program are to increase access to its collections and provide wider use of its rich resources in the areas of medicine, health care and public health while preserving rare, valuable and fragile materials.
1207	0	a	Because selection criteria for access are often different from those for preservation, the Library has created a different set of selection criteria for each mission.
1208	0	a	Each approach focuses on all types of materials in the Library?s collections including but not limited to printed monographs and journals, manuscripts and archives, prints and photographs, and audiovisuals.
1209	0	a	http://www.nlm.nih.gov/psd/pcm/devpermanence.html ? Security The Library will follow the HHS/NIH/OCCS security policies for the NLM Digital Repository.
1210	1	a	6.2 Policies to be Reviewed ? NLM DTD book formats The NLM Digital Repository will require more expansive, robust DTD encoding for textual materials than is currently available with the NLM Book and Historical Book DTDs.
1211	0	a	The group recommends the use of the TEI DTD in addition to the NLM Book and NLM Historical Book DTDs for encoding certain text materials.
1212	0	a	A more detailed justification is included in the report accompanying these requirements.
1213	1	a	? NLM Metadata Schemes The NLM Metadata scheme should be reviewed to see if it meets current needs.
1214	0	a	NLM has published an approved metadata schema based on Dublin Core (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/cataloging/metafilenew.html).
1215	0	a	The needs of the Repository may require a new schema or additional schemas, more congruent with the existing NLMCommon DTD and the NLMCatalogRecord DTD.
1216	0	a	(Available at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/licensee.html) 6.3 Policies to be Developed ? Migration Strategies/Methodologies A key area identified that will need policy development is migration strategies and methodologies.
1217	0	a	Policies will also be needed on the decision-making process about whether or when new repository standards will be adopted and when an object can be removed from the repository.
1218	0	a	An OAIS-compliant repository is an organization of people and systems, which has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a Designated Community.
1219	0	a	OAIS provides a conceptual framework from which the Library can define the core requirements of the NLM Digital Repository.
1220	1	a	The OAIS functional model (Figure 2) is separated into six functional entities and related interfaces.
1221	1	a	For reference purposes the OAIS function descriptions are reproduced using Italic font.
1222	1	a	The requirements of the Library are documented in non-italic font.
1223	1	a	A requirement reference number is noted to the left of text that describes the requirement.
1224	1	a	For the NLM Digital Repository, the process of Ingestion is composed of several different functions involved with the processing of selected material to be added to the repository.
1225	1	a	The actually workflow for this section will vary, depending upon how and when materials are selected and acquired.
1226	0	a	Material Submission and Review ? Authentication of materials ? Content inventory and virus checking of submitted material.
1227	0	a	? Reviewing submitted materials for acceptance/approval ? Reviewing materials for correct file formats 3.
1228	1	a	All material that is stored in the repository will enter it via the Ingest function.
1229	1	a	The function must support the bulk ingest of material as well as ingest of individual objects.
1230	1	a	The materials submitted must undergo several different quality assurance review processes and potential file conversion in preparation for being stored in the repository.
1231	0	a	See Appendix B for the list of formats categorized by level of support.
1232	0	a	7.1.1 Receive Submission The Receive Submission function provides the appropriate storage capability or devices to receive a SIP from the Producer (or from Administration).
1233	0	a	Digital SIPs may be delivered via electronic transfer (e.g., FTP), loaded from media submitted to the archive, or simply mounted (e.g., CD-ROM) on the archive file system for access.
1234	0	a	Non-digital SIPs would likely be delivered by conventional shipping procedures.
1235	1	a	The Receive Submission function may represent a legal transfer of custody for the Content Information in the SIP, and may require that special access controls be placed on the contents.
1236	1	a	This function provides a confirmation of receipt of a SIP to the Producer, which may include a request to resubmit a SIP in the case of errors resulting from the SIP submission.
1237	0	a	In general, the Content Originators with whom NLM negotiates submission agreements (as detailed in Section 7.4.1) are the content producers (those producing published material, i.e.
1238	0	a	publishers) and content donors.
1239	1	a	The Library will proactively work with producers and donors to agree on the content, quality and format of digital material and submission schedules.
1240	0	a	Some Content Providers may have irregular schedules and will submit material on an ad-hoc basis.
1241	1	a	The Library will specify preferred formats for the receipt of digital material.
1242	1	a	The Library may want to accept important digital materials in non-standard formats in case we are able to migrate them to a more usable format in the future.
1243	0	a	For example, scientific data or holographs may be submitted as part of the modern manuscripts program.
1244	1	a	Once material has arrived, it must undergo several reviews, including virus checking, format compliance and anticipated content and file type.
1245	1	a	In some cases, the review and approval step will also include approval of the submitted content.
1246	1	a	In other cases, the content type may already have been approved and this aspect does not need to be reviewed again.
1247	1	a	The repository system must include the ability to record all actions and decisions made concerning the submitted material.
1248	1	a	The reasons for rejection will be provided back to the Content Provider.
1249	0	a	In some cases, the provider can then resubmit corrected materials, while in other instances the rejection criteria should prevent the provider from submitting the same or similar material at a later time period.
1250	1	a	When submitted material is approved, it will be processed/prepared for ingestion into the repository.
1251	1	a	This procedure will include the generation of the Archival Information Package (AIP) that ensures that the material conforms to the repository data formatting and documentation standards.
1252	1	a	Metadata will be generated, and the components of the AIP will be stored in the system.
1253	1	a	Data will be converted to accepted file formats, as needed.
1254	1	a	Two types of conversions that have been identified are: upgrading the version of file format being submitted (e.g., TIFF5 to TIFF6) or converting from one format to another (e.g., JPEG files to TIFF).
1255	1	a	A primary goal of the conversion of content for the repository is the preservation of the content.
1256	0	a	Priority will be given to preserving the intellectual content.

1258	1	a	7.1.1.1 Allows resources to be reviewed before a decision is made whether they should be retained.
1259	1	a	Review content as a method of the selection process Accept or reject content or file format.
1260	1	a	7.1.1.3 A minimal set of identifying information/metadata concerning rejection decisions must be recorded.
1261	1	a	7.1.1.4 A minimal set of identifying information/metadata concerning rejected submissions should provide a mechanism to eliminate the need to review some resubmissions.
1262	1	a	Certain reasons for rejection should prevent a possible resubmission.
1263	0	a	7.1.1.5 Allows notification of producers and donors about rejected content.
1264	0	a	7.1.1.6 Accepts content from physical media (DVDs, external drives, etc.)

1279	1	a	7.1.1.16 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.
1280	1	a	7.1.2 Quality Assurance The Quality Assurance function validates (QA results) the successful transfer of the SIP to the staging area.
1281	1	a	For digital submissions, these mechanisms might include Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) or checksums associated with each data file, or the use of system log files to record and identify any file transfer or media read/write errors.
1282	0	a	The purpose of Quality Assurance (QA) is to assure the Library that digital material is of sufficient quality to be stored in the NLM Digital Repository.
1283	1	a	Since manual QA is very time-consuming, QA activities should be as automated as possible, with the ability to override for manual QA when needed.
1284	1	a	Manual QA processes must be adjustable depending upon the origin of the file, which could dictate the level of QA required.

1294	0	a	7.1.2.9 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.
1295	1	a	7.1.3 Generate Archival Information Package (AIP) The Generate AIP function transforms one or more SIPs into one or more AIPs that conform to the archive?s data formatting and documentation standards.
1296	1	a	This may involve file format conversions, data representation conversions or reorganization of the content information in the SIPs.
1297	0	a	The Generate AIP function may issue report requests to Data Management to obtain reports of information needed by the Generate AIP function to produce the Descriptive Information that completes the AIP.
1298	0	a	This function sends SIPs or AIPs for audit to the Audit Submission function in Administration, and receives back an audit report.
1299	0	a	Archival Information Packets (AIP) are information packets of content converted to the archive standards identified in Appendix B.
1300	0	a	Generating the AIPs deals with transforming or repackaging of data to the current NLM archival standards.
1301	1	a	The system also provides reports containing metadata that may be used in later processes and functions.
1302	1	a	The Library will develop policies that govern where the individual components of an AIP are stored.
1303	1	a	The policy may vary dependent upon a number of factors; for example, the type of digital object, access rights, and conditions of use.

1308	0	a	This includes metadata to support searching and retrieving AIPs (e.g., who, what, when, where, why), and could also include special browse products (thumbnails, images) to be used by Finding Aids.
1309	0	a	NLM broadly interprets the term Descriptive Information to include descriptive, administrative and structural metadata needed for retrieval and management of digital objects (See Appendix C for metadata definitions.)
1310	0	a	Metadata is generated during the Generate Archival Information Package functions.
1311	0	a	7.1.4.1 Allows entry and validation of additional metadata (e.g.
1312	0	a	subject headings, names, dates, ?curatorial? descriptive metadata - evaluative information that explains why an object is important, whether it was part of a larger collection (e.g., an exhibit), etc.).
1313	1	a	? Basic descriptive metadata will also be stored with the objects (e.g., unique identifier, title and date stored in the TIFF header) so that the objects can still be identified in the event that information in the database is corrupted.
1314	0	a	? See Appendix D for examples of TIFF header metadata requirements.
1315	0	a	7.1.4.7 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.
1316	0	a	7.1.5 Coordinate Updates The Coordinate Updates function is responsible for transferring the AIPs to Archival Storage and the Descriptive Information to Data Management.
1317	1	a	Transfer of the AIP includes a storage request and may represent an electronic, physical, or a virtual (i.e., data stays in place) transfer.
1318	0	a	After the transfer is completed and verified, Archival Storage returns a storage confirmation indicating (or verifying) the storage identification information for the AIP.
1319	1	a	The Coordinate Updates function also incorporates the storage identification information into the Descriptive Information for the AIP and transfers it to the Data Management entity along with a database update request.
1320	1	a	In return, Data Management provides a database update response indicating the status of the update.
1321	1	a	Data Management updates may take place without a corresponding Archival Storage transfer when the SIP contains Descriptive Information for an AIP already in Archival Storage.
1322	1	a	The individual components of an AIP may be physically stored in different locations within the repository.

1332	0	a	7.2 Archival Storage Archival Storage provides the services and functions for the storage, maintenance and retrieval of AIPs.
1333	1	a	7.2.1 Receive Data The Receive Data function receives a storage request and an AIP from Ingest and moves the AIP to permanent storage within the archive.
1334	0	a	The transfer request may need to indicate the anticipated frequency of utilization of the data objects comprising the AIP in order to allow the appropriate storage devices or media to be selected for storing the AIP.
1335	1	a	This function will select the media type, prepare the devices or volumes, and perform the physical transfer to the Archival Storage volumes.
1336	0	a	Upon completion of the transfer, this function sends a storage confirmation message to Ingest, including the storage identification of the AIPs.
1337	0	a	7.2.1.1 Receives AIPs from Ingest.
1338	0	a	7.2.1.4 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.
1339	1	a	It will also conform to any special levels of service required for the AIP, or any special security measures that are required, and ensures the appropriate level of protection for the AIP.
1340	0	a	These include on-line, off-line or near-line storage, required throughput rate, maximum allowed bit error rate, or special handling or backup procedures.
1341	0	a	It monitors error logs to ensure AIPs are not corrupted during transfers.

1347	1	a	Within the Replace Media function the Content Information and Preservation Description Information (PDI) must not be altered.
1348	0	a	However, the data constituting the Packaging Information may be changed as long as it continues to perform the same function and there is a straightforward implementation that does not cause information loss.
1349	1	a	The migration strategy must select a storage medium, taking into consideration the expected and actual rates of errors encountered in various media types, their performance, and their costs of ownership.
1350	1	a	Anticipating the terminology of section 0, this function may perform Refreshment, Replication, and Repackaging that is straightforward.
1351	0	a	An example of such Repackaging is migration to new media under a new operating system and file system, where the Content Information and PDI are independent of the file systems.

1355	1	a	7.2.4 Error Checking and Disaster Recovery The Error Checking function provides statistically acceptable assurance that no components of the AIP are corrupted during any internal Archival Storage data transfer.
1356	1	a	This function requires that all hardware and software within the archive provide notification of potential errors and that these errors are routed to standard error logs that are checked by the Archival Storage staff.
1357	0	a	The PDI Fixity Information provides some assurance that the Content Information has not been altered as the AIP is moved and accessed.
1358	0	a	Similar information is needed to protect the PDI itself.
1359	0	a	A standard mechanism for tracking and verifying the validity of all data objects within the archive may also be used.
1360	0	a	For example, CRCs could be maintained for every individual data file.
1361	0	a	A higher level of service, such as Reed-Solomon coding to support combined error detection and correction, could also be provided.
1362	1	a	The storage facility procedures should provide for random verification of the integrity of data objects using CRCs or some other error checking mechanism.
1363	1	a	The Disaster Recovery function provides a mechanism for supplicating the digital contents of the archive collection and storing the duplicate in a physically separate facility.
1364	0	a	This function is normally accomplished by copying the archive contents to some form of removable storage media (e.g.

1419	0	a	A major point of discussion is a sustainable and reliable |ong-term vision for exchanging attestations among Member States.
1420	0	a	This requires a paradigm shift towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and certificates that are currently just barely available in electronic form.
1421	0	a	The creation of uniform infrastructure in this heterogeneous domain will take some time as several different environments and stakeholders need to be involved, and change may not be enforceable to all of them.
1422	0	a	The aim is to support basic interoperability and exchange of documents on the lower maturity levels and leading towards direct electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity levels.
1423	0	a	Thereby each maturity level is built upon the lower ones thus allowing integration and step by step advancement.
1424	0	a	In the following we will introduce the staged maturity model for the VCD as depicted in Figure 2.
1425	0	a	eXCIUEiOn 80d Quaii?? exclusion docs criteria docs criteria Figure 2: Vision of VCD (staged maturity model) The stages express different levels of maturity with respect to interoperability.
1426	0	a	A staged implementation approach is necessary in order to handle the complexity of the domain and to take into account the needs of the Member States.
1427	1	a	Every Member State should develop a solution that meets the demands of basic interoperability.
1428	0	a	Basic interoperability can thereby be defined as a state where organisational transparency of cross?border tendering requirements is established (stage 1- pre-VCD mapping tool).
1429	0	a	The efforts and expenses to develop a solution that ensures basic interoperability ought to be manageable and affordable.
1430	1	a	The VCD specification must be generically and semantically extensible in order to reach a sustainable and fully-?edged solution in the final stage.
1431	1	a	An eTendering system and a contracting authority must be able to interpret a VCD package assembled by a VCD application regardless of the implementation stage of the VCD application and the eTendering system.
1432	0	a	Figure 2 illustrates the staged maturity model of the VCD that has been designed to show the different stages of implementation and development.
1433	0	a	In terms of construction and implementation, the VCD may be seen as a solution focusing on the European interoperability on the basis of European/national requirements and legislation.
1434	0	a	It is therefore necessary to ensure national transparency by gathering national requirements on certi?cates and quali?cation documents.
1435	0	a	The next step then is to de?ne the structure of a VCD by adding several types of (meta)data into it (e.g.
1436	0	a	evidences, structural data of the evidences, translations etc.)
1437	1	a	and to build an application that is able to compile VCDs and enabling economic operators to submit this information electronically to contracting authorities (Stage 2).
1438	0	a	Beside this, stage 3 will focus on additional services such as maintaining a VCD or composing a VCD from different economic operators in case of bidding consortia.
1439	1	a	Stage 4 (VCD networked package) will then provide a sophisticated method for changing the overall process from push to pull.
1440	0	a	A contracting authority will receive a VCD on the basis of stage 2 and 3 (push) but the documents itself will not be submitted anymore.
1441	1	a	Instead a contracting authority can request those documents on demand from a database (pull) at national service provider who hosts VCD services, or directly from the very registration authority.
1442	1	a	The VCD networked package will provide the basis for further developments towards an electronic exchange of evidence.
1443	0	a	The stages follow a generic approach and may be seen as the evolution or development according to an underlying maturity model.
1444	0	a	The model as presented in Figure 2 is further described in the following subsection with the purpose to detail the various stages.
1445	0	a	3 Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.
1446	1	a	0 VCD can provide direct access to attestation if there is a mandatory rule for it in law.
1447	1	a	0 VCD systems provide single point of contact to attestations from public sources and information necessary to prove conformance to a given call for tender.
1448	1	a	0 A VCD Package may be linked to exactly one call for tender thus it is tender speci?c 0 A VCD Package may contain self?declarations and several other documents provided by the economic operator.
1449	1	a	The level that will be reached by a Member State and the path to go will depend upon the goals and decisions of each single Member State.
1450	1	a	On the PeppolNVP2 strategy there is explicit interest to have parallel increments on both sides, assuming that the semantic enrichment of the VCD package requires a corresponding enriched supporting system.
1451	0	a	This means, the higher the level of support, the higher the interoperability between the Member States (enabled by richer semantics of the information provided in the VCD Package).
1452	1	a	Services can be human beings, organisations as well as lT-services.
1453	1	a	On this level of support the VCD rule set is defined as a reference model which is manually or semi- automatically consulted by the economic operator and/or the contracting authority.
1454	1	a	There are no VCD Services established which compile, validate or deliver VCD-Packages.
1455	1	a	On this level of support, the VCD Service can deduce from the provided structural metadata, whether the VCD Package is complete or not and if its evidences are valid or outdated.
1456	1	a	2.1.3.2 Level of Completeness A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested evidences (all that are necessary to prove all requested criteria) are contained in it.
1457	0	a	The range of evidences varies from self?declarations to official attestations or certi?cates issued by public authorities (see Figure 7 for a categorization).
1458	1	a	From a pragmatic point of view, it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of evidences in a first step and to complete the VCD Package later on.
1459	1	a	"It is also reasonable to define a default package list that has to be provided in most public tenders by economic operators independently of particular criteria mentioned by the ?Call for Tender""."
1460	0	a	From these considerations we can derive the following approach: 1.
1461	1	a	Create a VCD package
1462	0	a	Create a tender-speci?c VCD Package through interconnection of VCD and call for tender
1463	0	a	needed to proof criteria according to Articles 47 - 50 in the Directive 2004/18/EC later on in order to create a complete VCD-Package.
1464	0	a	2.1.4 Criteria for qualification and selection and non-exclusion The criteria for qualitative selection and non-exclusion as defined in the Directive 2004/18/EC are the common ground for building a cross border VCD service.
1465	0	a	The ?gure below shows the relevant criteria as de?ned in Articles 45-50 as these are regarded the most common ground when mapping any national criteria to the European ones.
1466	0	a	The personal situation of a candidate (Article 45) can be for example further described by: 0 Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard to absence of conviction (sec.
1467	0	a	45 ?2 (a- b)) 0 Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard compliance with fiscal and social obligations (sec.
1468	0	a	So there will be basic information and compilation support provided in a first step.
1469	0	a	Names, contents and qualities of VCD vary between countries, and in many cases economic operators are using the options of Article 51 to add additional up-to-date information from public registries.
1470	0	a	2.1.5 Steps on the path of development 0 National criteria and attestations: The ?rst step delivers information on all the national attestations as well as on where and how to get them.
1471	0	a	0 European mapping, economic operator specific: The second step provides a mapping of national attestations which evidence criteria defined by Directive 2004/18/EC7, and with a particular focus on Articles 45 and 46.
1472	0	a	This is a ?rst move towards cross-border interoperability.
1473	1	a	0 Extended European criteria set and mapping: The third step completes the information support by adding all the other criteria in Articles 47 to 50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC on a high level and where possible on sub criteria/atomic criteria level.
1474	1	a	At this step the economic operators are supported with all the necessary information for participating in cross border tenders.
1475	1	a	The third step is a minimum requirement to meet for all Member States participating in the PEPPOL- VCD-project thus it can be defined as a common goal.
1476	0	a	It is a precondition to guarantee cross border interoperability.
1477	0	a	The mapping is necessary for a correct system specification and further development according to the overall maturity model enabling improvements with regard to level of support.
1478	1	a	A Member State may reduce the level of completeness with regard to compilation and decision support with regard to their Pilot, but information support should be provided to all criteria at least on a high level.
1479	1	a	Beyond the third step, every MS may decide which path to follow and which level to achieve.
1480	0	a	The path of development provides an idea of how to structure the national VCD project.
1481	0	a	One may decide to settle for the second level of support, but focus on the most commonly used attestations (a minimum for this level of support).
1482	1	a	A MS may next decide to stay there (no move), or to complete his service (move to the right) or to keep the narrow focus and head for the highest level of support (move upwards) (cf.
1483	1	a	Thereby the Status quo procedure of section 1.2 remains unchanged, except that a pre-VCD mapping exists which is implemented and provided through a European service provider8 (see Figure 5).
1484	1	a	The mapping tool provides information to the economic operator on which national attestations of his or her country ful?ll the criteria set by the procuring agency in the respective country (steps 4, 5).
1485	1	a	Likewise, the contracting authority can check evidences and authorizations provided by economic operators via the pre-VCD mapping tool (step 9).
1486	1	a	Tenders Electronic (?l Daily (TED) To fulfill a first precondition for a VCD package as introduced in Stages 2 and beyond, the pre-VCD mapping tool is the proposed function and the process that allows for its execution.
1487	0	a	It consists of a tool and of a data structure representing different contexts.
1488	0	a	These contexts are linked to the national public procurement domains and a single European common domain.
1489	1	a	For every domain we suppose to get a representation of a national index which provides an overview of national criteria demanded in public procurement, and how these are evidenced (i.e.
1490	0	a	which attestations and/or statements provide what evidence).
1491	1	a	This index also indicates structural data of evidence for example the issuer of the individual attestations or statements and the service it may activate for public or reserved access.
1492	0	a	Figure 6 depicts the general taxonomy for the pre-VCD mapping concept, while Figure 7 shows a detailed taxonomy of the concept ?evidence?.
1493	0	a	V\?th this taxonomy, it is possible to map the fact that evidences can either be provided by the candidate himself (e.g.
1494	0	a	self?declaration, declaration on oath, solemn statement) or specific issuers as certified authorities and/or [authorized] third parties.
1495	0	a	It implies the design and rolling out of a tool for supporting the basic interoperability between different legal conditions for providing evidence in public procurement procedures.
1496	0	a	As stated in the introduction, it can be seen as a minimum requirement for all Member States participating in the PEPPOL VCD work package.
1497	1	a	At this stage, a semantic model is introduced that supports guidance in applying the relevant community rules on mutual recognition of evidences (e.g.
1498	1	a	diplomas, certificates or other evidences of formal quali?cations) in cross-border procurement procedures.
1499	1	a	The semantic model especially requires and provides for: o a mapping between available national attestations and the selection and exclusion criteria set by the contracting authority through European criteria.
1500	0	a	As European criteria are the same for all Member States, they act as the pivot element for the mapping.
1501	1	a	0 The contracting authority can check through the same mapping mechanism whether the submitted attestations express ful?lment with the relevant criteria or requirements.
1502	1	a	0 The contracting authority can activate a direct access to attestations that are exposed through open services, including the international cross-linking.

1511	1	a	The Call for Tender contains the de?nition of evidences and the specific criteria on qualitative selection and exclusion that are relevant to this particular call.
1512	1	a	If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular Call for Tender he can directly retrieve relevant information about evidences and criteria by using the information published in the Call for Tender.
1513	1	a	In cases below threshold or in the cases where the public notice is partial, the economic operator might send a direct request to the contracting authority in order to retrieve the required information.
1514	1	a	Having the relevant criteria in place the economic operator will be enabled to get a mapping to the national attestations that refer to those criteria via the pre-VCD mapping tool.
1515	1	a	The same process can be performed by the contracting authority in order to check whether the submitted attestations adequately ful?l certain criteria asked for.

1539	0	a	The performance models to demonstrate the effects of peering and to predict user perceived performance [4]. '
1540	0	a	CDN peering models along With the challenges for implementation [5].
1541	1	a	Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise.
1542	0	a	It is formed by a set of autonomous CDNs, Which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure for cooperation in order to Virtualize multiple providers.
1543	0	a	It is expected that an effective peering arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur.
1544	0	a	Initiation: A CDN?s reach and scale is limited by its ability to handle peak load, cost of equipment, scalable infrastructure, and/or demand for the increased coverage of its infrastructure.
1545	0	a	Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing With other CDN(s).
1546	1	a	The triggering condition must consider the expected and unexpected load increases in the initiating CDN.
1547	0	a	Negotiated relationship: The controlling interest of a CDN to interconnect With other CDNs leads to the creation of a negotiated relationship.
1548	0	a	Negotiated relationships can also be established through means non- technical terms (financial statement) or technical terms (SLAs).
1549	1	a	Thus, negotiated relationships must specify the interactions among entities including service administration, coordination and disband (or re-arrangement) of internetworked CDNs.
1550	0	a	In the CDN peering architecture, the mediator instance obtains the resource and access information from the Service Registry (SR), Whilst SLAs and other policies from the Policy Repository (PR).
1551	1	a	The mediator instance on the primary CDN?s behalf generates its service requirements based on the current circumstance and SLA requirements of its customer(s).
1552	0	a	Resource discovery: Once the initiating CDN identi?es its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with.
1553	1	a	The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers.
1554	1	a	The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs.
1555	1	a	If there are any preexisting peering arrangements (for a long term scenario) then these will be returned at this point.
1556	0	a	Otherwise, it carries out short term negotiations with the Peering Agent (PA) identi?ed peering targets.
1557	0	a	CDN peering protocols: The next step is to con?gure the ?CDN peering? protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly speci?ed through the negotiated relationships.
1558	0	a	This step includes advertising the con?gurations (topology aspects, geographical proximity, capability, performance, etc.)
1559	1	a	On establishment of a peering arrangement, these protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer.
1560	0	a	Hence, necessary functional policies are deployed and administered in an effective way.
1561	0	a	Once a peering arrangement is established, all participating parties cooperate in the execution of common goal(s).
1562	0	a	Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships.
1563	0	a	If no CDN is interested in such peering, peering arrangement creation through re-negotiation is resumed by tuning the negotiated relationships with reconsidered service requirements.
1564	0	a	Decrease cost of Web access, increase QoS through reduced latency, reduce server load, and bandwidth consumption (by a particular CDN server), thus improving the performance of content delivery.
1565	0	a	The operations performed by the product components [3] assist to realize the above goals.
1566	0	a	Component-wise maj or functions are noted below.
1567	1	a	The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents are as follows, A Web server replicates content on-demand from the origin server and stores it for future use.
1568	0	a	In the event of Web hotspot, it initiates request to trigger peering.
1569	1	a	The Web services host ensures the delivery of content to end-users based on the negotiated policies with other CDNs.
1570	1	a	The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted.
1571	1	a	The Web servers? underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers.
1572	1	a	The Mediator performs the following maj or functions, It generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships.
1573	0	a	It passes the service requirements to the PA.
1574	1	a	It works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs.
1575	1	a	It helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details.
1576	1	a	In the face of traf?c surges, it supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator.
1577	0	a	When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources.
1578	1	a	The Policy Repository is used to perform the following functions, It Virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including Pws, PM, and Ppeenng (i.e.
1579	0	a	Web server-speci?c policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peerin g arrangement.
1580	1	a	So?ware Requirements Specification for Page 6 Internetworking 0f CDNs through Peering ' It provides a set of rules to the mediator to administer, manage, and control access to the resources in a peering arrangement. '
1581	1	a	It returns existing peering policies to the PA during the establishment of long-term peering arrangements.
1582	1	a	A Peering Agent carries out the following major functions, ' It acts as a policy-driven resource discovery module for establishing negotiations. '
1583	1	a	It exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs. '
1584	0	a	It is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with PAs of other peers and to acquire resources from them.
1585	0	a	These maj or architectural features of the CDN peering are brie?y described in the following: ' Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data.
1586	1	a	Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute. '

1588	1	a	The gateways of participating CDNs then communicate aggregated load information describing the load of their constituent servers. '
1589	1	a	Request assignment and redirection is performed at multiple levels 7 at the DNS, at the gateways to local clusters, and also (redirection) between servers in a cluster.
1590	1	a	Therefore, end- users can be assigned Via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also Via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate.
1591	1	a	2.3 User Classes and Characteristics The users of the software infrastructure enabling CDN peering can be differentiated by using their membership and contributions to the system.
1592	0	a	A given peering arrangement consists of explicit and implicit members.
1593	1	a	Explicit members include the primary CDN, which is the initiator of a peering relationship, and any peering CDNs who cooperate for resource sharing.
1594	1	a	Implicit members are content providers and end?users.
1595	1	a	Implicit members are transparent to a peering arrangement but they share the bene?t from it.
1596	1	a	In addition, users can vary based on the purpose, size, scope and duration of peering.
1597	0	a	For instance, a short?term peering arrangement is to be automated to react within a tight time frame?as it is unlikely that a human directed negotiation would occur quickly enough to satisfy the evolved niche.
1598	0	a	On the other hand, establishment of a long-term peering arrangement calls for a human-directed agent to ensure that any resulting decisions comply with participating CDNs? strategic goals.
1599	1	a	Users can also be classi?ed because of the preferential treatment that they may receive due to the policy that pertains to a particular provider?s business logic.
1600	1	a	Moreover, individual users (or a group of users) can have dynamic QoS requirements depending on the situations that will result in ?customized? content delivery.
1601	1	a	Thus, users (or class of users) can be differentiated based on user- de?ned QoS speci?cations while accessing the service.
1602	0	a	In this regard, existing Web services technologies will be studied in detail to examine the feasibility of leveraging them.
1603	0	a	A modular implementation stack could be developed on top of the existing standard application layer (e.g.
1604	0	a	A modular implementation approach would be useful to perform testing on modules at different stages to ensure correct implementation.
1605	1	a	It is anticipated that a cryptographically secure auction-based framework will be used to assist content replication among peered CDNs to allow incentives for all participants.
1606	1	a	Load information could be measured and disseminated within individual CDNs and among other CDNs using distributed load indices such as Distributed Hash Table (DHT) or variations of it.
1607	0	a	2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints The challenges in developing the product include Virtualization of multiple providers and of?oading end-user requests from the primary CDN provider to peers based on cost, performance and load.
1608	0	a	Due to the proprietary nature of existing CDNs, limited information about response time or service cost is typically available from individual CDNs, and load balancing control is retained by an individual provider within its own Web servers.
1609	1	a	Therefore, request-redirections must occur over distributed sets of Web servers belonging to multiple CDN providers, without the bene?t of the full information available, as in the single provider case.
1610	1	a	Moreover, an implementation model for the product enabling CDN peering could be based on a complex combination of attributes such as Web server responsiveness or load, expected network delay, or geographic location.
1611	1	a	Several of these potential attributes vary over time and there is no single repository for listing the value of attributes such as geographic location or expected delay for all Internet-connected systems.
1612	1	a	It is anticipated that the values used in a CDN peering implementation model are likely to be based on heuristics.

1614	0	a	It would be written for non- technical individuals and the level of content or terminology would differ considerably from, for example, a System Administration Guide, which is more detailed and complex.
1615	0	a	2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies The product would build on leveraging existing systems.
1616	0	a	In this regard, necessary inspirations could be obtained by analyzing related systems such as CoDeeN, Coral, Globule, and MotusNet.
1617	0	a	In particular, the design and implementation approach of MotusNet could be helpful to draw a clear guideline for developing the intended prototype.

2058	0	a	This document does not make any further reference to the Confidential ? Ed Altorfer, Walker Lindley, Chris Page 6 Haller, Stefan Moluf, 2007
2059	0	a	This document also forms the basis for continuing discussions with stakeholders and sponsors, to enhance and further describe those requirements to be included in future enhancements to Moodle.
2060	0	a	We are making an assumption that Moodle is of interest to the University as a viable choice to replace Blackboard.
2061	0	a	The goal of this document, and our work, however, is to determine what any courseware system would need to qualify as a viable solution for the University.
2062	0	a	We also intend to apply this document to Moodle to determine whether we can implement some of the features that Moodle lacks and our stakeholders find to be important.
2063	0	a	Our stakeholder feedback was gathered to help us determine the requirements of a replacement courseware system and provide analysis of the feature set in other available solutions.
2064	0	a	User Characteristics Students Students are the primary consumers of a courseware system.
2065	0	a	They are accessing information posted by professors, uploading assignments and project files, and discussing concepts. Professors Professors are the primary content administrators of a courseware system.
2066	0	a	They contribute minimally to the courses themselves, but spend more time modifying the system?s configuration and making appropriate updates. 2.4 Stakeholder Needs
2067	0	a	In order to determine what enhancements needed to be made to Moodle, we interviewed system stakeholders (e.g., professors and students) to determine what, if anything, is lacking in our existing courseware solution.
2068	0	a	Our requirements and supplementary requirements are based on that feedback which is summarized in Moodle Requirements Brainstorming.pdf(referenced in section 1.4.1). 3.
2069	0	a	Specific Requirements The priorities defined below reflect the requirements of the development team.
2070	1	a	The system must be able to capture and manage files where appropriate.
2071	1	a	One of the fundamental tasks of the system is to allow actors to upload and manage files on certain pages of the system.
2072	1	a	These might include assignment submission pages, forum pages, wiki pages, and announcement pages.
2073	1	a	Actors in the capacity of course administrator or professor should be able to enable multiple file uploads on a page of his or her choosing.
2074	1	a	For collaborative projects, it becomes important for actors to be able to upload more than one file to a given page, especially in the case of an assignment submission where the assignment might include multiple parts.
2075	1	a	Such a construct should be offered to the actor during a page?s creation and editing stages.
2076	1	a	The system must be able to capture and organize voice clips that can be used where appropriate.
2077	1	a	Actors in the role of professor or system administrator should be allowed to partition this space for actors in the roles of students.
2078	1	a	This can be done one of two ways: 1) the actor can be allowed to preview the voice clip before it is archived and determine whether or not he or she would like that clip to be archived, or 2) a newly created voice clip can be automatically archived.
2079	1	a	The first option would allow the actor to throw out an audio clip that is deemed to be unsuitable or inappropriate for an assignment without having to take it out of an archive of voice clips.
2080	1	a	The actor should have the option to have the voice clip be archived after a preview has taken place.
2081	1	a	The second option would automatically archive a voice clip once submitted but would require that the actor interact with the archived file.
2082	1	a	Thus, if the actor chooses to delete the file, it would need to be deleted from the archive of voice clips.
2083	1	a	Maintaining an archive of voice clips makes it possible for comparisons to be made between clips to determine whether an actor is improving his or her language skills over multiple courses.
2084	1	a	The actor should be able to optionally attach one of his or her archived items to any page where uploads are permitted.
2085	1	a	The term archive used above may also be referred to as a portfolio.
2086	1	a	The system must allow actors to download their voice clips in a flexibleformat.
2087	1	a	Voice clips should be optionally downloadable in a format such as MPEG Audio (mp3) format, since it is widely supported across different web browsers and operating systems.
2088	1	a	Voice clips should be downloadable for archival purposes orfor the purpose of presenting them to other actors.
2089	1	a	The system must store audio clips in a format conducive to speech.
2090	1	a	Voice clips should be stored in a format optimized for speech since this feature is meant to catalog voice recordings.
2091	1	a	This allows him or her to manage archived voice clips and to create a cohesive portfolio that actors in the role of professor can use tojudge improvement over time. 3.3 Web Feeds
2092	1	a	Actors in the role of course administrators should have the ability to determine which of these components have feeds and to whom these feeds should pertain.
2093	1	a	If actors are unable to be notified in some way of new content in Moodle, they are unable to efficiently keep track of a course?s current affairs.
2094	1	a	For this requirement, page refers to any distinct block (e.g., assignments, wikis, forum threads, etc.).
2095	1	a	The system must be able to use search functionality as a way to navigate Moodle pages instead of using hierarchical links. Moodle can be difficult to navigate and requires too many clicks to be efficiently used.
2096	1	a	Too many steps to complete basic actions?such as submitting an assignment?lead to frustration on the part of the actor.
2097	1	a	A search utility enables actors to find what they are looking for quickly in addition to having a hierarchical approach to finding functions of the course management system.
2098	1	a	For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page, such as an assignment, a wiki page, or a forum post.
2099	1	a	An actor must be able to search through pages in a course. Actors should be able to search for pages at the course level, since most actors will be searching for material in a given course.
2100	1	a	The search feature should be present in two ways.
2101	1	a	Confidential ? Ed Altorfer, Walker Lindley, Chris Page 10 First, it should be present in the form of a search box and a ?Search? button on the top or bottom of every page.
2102	1	a	In addition to the basic search field, this page should allow an actor to filter out certain results (such as forum posts or grades, etc.) and search specific sections (or components) of the course management system.
2103	1	a	Results should appear in categories (e.g., Assignments, Wiki Pages, Forum Posts, etc.) based on relevance.
2104	1	a	In this case, relevance is determined by results that having the highest number terms matching the search terms.
2105	1	a	When the actor clicks a search result link, they should be taken to the page corresponding to the search result.
2106	1	a	In addition, the search page described above might allow for the possibility of searching the world wide web using a standard search engine such as Google.
2107	1	a	The system must display a search box on every page after an actor has logged in. Actors should be able to search from any page.
2108	1	a	If the actor is hierarchically outside of a particular course, each of his or her courses should be searched and results should be grouped by course.
2109	1	a	Ifthe actor is hierarchically inside of a course, that course should be searched with an option to search all courses.
2110	1	a	The system must allow actors in the capacity of course administrator to post grades associated with assignments for a particular actor in the capacity of student.
2111	1	a	Actors in the role of professor may want to optionally grade assignments online since they are being submitted electronically by actors in the role of student.
2112	1	a	Priority: 1 A course administrator must be able to grade on assignment. Course administrators should be able to post grades for an assignment based on the ratio of points earned to points possible.
2113	1	a	The course administrator should also be able to attach feedback in the form of text or an attachment (as described above).
2114	1	a	Time stamps should be attached to the last time the grade was modified so that actors may examine when particular grades were submitted and how an actor in the role of student has improved or lessened his performance in the course.
2115	1	a	The system should display grade information to the appropriate actor. The system should display grade information such as the grade for each assignment, averages, and overall grade to the actor to whom the grades belong.
2116	1	a	No other actor should be able to view another?s grades except an actor in the role of course administrator for the course to which the grades belong.
2117	1	a	The system should maintain a grade history. The system should maintain a history of grades for a particular assignment if the course administrator changes them.
2118	1	a	Course administrators can also track how they have changed a score over time using the timestamps associated with each change to the gradebook. 3.6 Social Networking Applications
2119	0	a	The social, collaborative components of Moodle are not very robust.
2120	0	a	There are better, freely- available solutions which should be integrated into Moodle to provide the best functionality possible for all actors without having to use 3rd party services.
2121	1	a	A freely available wiki should provide a simple markup language that actors can use to style their input, as well as link to other pages in the wiki.
2122	1	a	More importantly, having the wiki inside Moodle reduces confusion and allows for the integration of notifications and logins. 3.6.2
2123	1	a	The system must provide a blog engine.
2124	1	a	A freely available blog engine should provide all modern blog functionality, such as tagging, drafting, and comments.
2125	1	a	These blogs should share authentication and notification with Moodle. 3.7 Notifications
2126	0	a	Currently, there is no system that allows actors to receive SMS or email notifications of changes to Moodle pages (such as assignments or announcements). Priority: 3 3.7.1
2127	1	a	The system must provide both e-mail and SMS notifications for pages. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum post, etc.).
2128	1	a	When a page is created, the actor in the role of course administrator should be able to toggle whether notifications are turned on.
2129	1	a	By default, they should be turned on for announcements.
2130	1	a	They should also be able to manage their notification subscriptions (for example, remove themselves from notifications). 4.
2131	0	a	General System Functional Requirements 4.1 Usability 4.1.1
2132	1	a	As far as possible, the system should provide a simple, responsive interface.
2133	1	a	Although any courseware solution may be composed of diverse systems, applications, and processes, the underlying architecture should be transparent to the administrators.
2134	1	a	Furthermore, this interface must allow administrators to easily change themes and other setting that affect page layout across the entire courseware system. Priority: 3 Reliability
2135	1	a	The system must be backed up on a configurable schedule. Back-up requirements will need to be determined, based on individual components of the system.
2136	1	a	The system should be backed up with a frequency that ensures system and course data is protected.
2137	1	a	Since assignments will be submitted via the system, it should be backed up on a nightly basis, with options for weekly, off-site backup when necessary.
2138	0	a	Priority: 2 The system should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
2139	1	a	This statement provides a general sense of system availability.
2140	1	a	It is not intended to demand the system maintain reliability, or to require the system to be highly available.
2141	1	a	It should not exclude maintenance windows, or scheduled downtime.
2142	1	a	It is only intended to convey the expectation that our customers should have access to the system during off-hours as well as business hours. 99% up-time should be considered sufficient to meet this requirement.
2143	1	a	The system should support at least 1000 concurrent users.
2144	1	a	This statement provides a general sense of reliability when the system is under load.
2145	1	a	It is important that a substantial number of actors be able to access the system at the same time, since a courseware system is important to the courses that employ it.
2146	1	a	The times when the system will be under the most stress are likely during midterm and finals weeks.
2147	1	a	Therefore, it must be able to handle at least 1,000 concurrent users.
2148	1	a	The system must be maintainable without substantial modification. Due to limited staff in the Office of Information Services, it is important that the system be mostly self?sustaining.
2149	1	a	This will reduce the number of FTE hours spent maintaining the system and simplify maintenance tasks.
2150	1	a	Users must have easy access to help while interacting with the system.
2151	1	a	Adequate user documentation should be provided to minimize the number of calls to the Help Desk about problems with the system.
2152	1	a	Modifications should be reported via the main page to inform actors of unexpected changes.
2153	1	a	A comprehensive database of maintenance tasks and help files should be compiled to make the courseware system easier to maintain from an IT staff point-of?view.
2154	1	a	Search results should be displayed based on relevance.
2155	1	a	This documentation must cover all procedures necessary for regular maintenance with links to additional information, all common errors, and links or documentation for advanced troubleshooting.

2162	0	a	References The reference documents below were used to prepare this requirements document: 1.5.
2163	0	a	Overview The remainder of this document is divided into two sections.
2164	0	a	Section 2 gives a high-level, user- and operationally-oriented view of the software.
2165	0	a	Section 3 provides the detailed requirements including explicitly stated and derived functional requirements from which the RLCS Application will be designed.
2166	0	a	Overall description This section describes the general factors that affect the RLCS Application software requirements.
2167	0	a	This section does not state specific requirements, instead it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3.
2168	1	a	The RLCS Application will allow an operator to view system status and issue commands to change device status as well as configure the system and generate reports.
2169	0	a	The five major functions of the RLCS application software are a Graphical User Interface (GUI), Process Control and Monitoring, Sequencing, Data Processing and Security, and Reporting.
2170	0	a	Product perspective This section describes how the RLCS Application software relates to other systems and software as well as how it functions internally.
2171	1	a	User Interface The user will operate the RLCS Application software using a graphical user interface.
2172	1	a	Hardware Interfaces RLCS application will seamlessly interface and control hardware devices.
2173	1	a	Communications Interfaces The RLCS will provide access to system status data, to external systems through a firewall.
2174	1	a	This will be a one way data transfer to a computer outside of the RLCS network and making it available there for public use.
2175	1	a	The transfer will occur every 30 seconds.
2176	1	a	A one way serial data transfer will also be provided.
2177	1	a	RLCS workstations and controllers will reside on a private network to communicate field device information.
2178	1	a	The RLCS private network communication media will include fiber, Cat 5 wiring Leased lines and dial-up lines Communications from the TMC to the DCU controllers is through the FCU controller.
2179	1	a	In addition, wireless connections between the FCU and DCU controllers are not an option due to security and interference considerations 2.1.6.
2180	1	a	Memory constraints The only memory constraints imposed on the software will depend on constraints associated with the intelligent controller selected for the system.
2181	1	a	Site Adaptation The RLCS Application will operate as a component of the RLCS System, for which physical adaptations are described in ?Section 3.7 Physical? of the System Requirements Specification 2.2.

2186	1	a	User characteristics Several classes of users will access the RLCS Application.
2187	1	a	A user is defined as anyone who has the ability to ?log on? to the RLCS.
2188	1	a	External entities such as ATMS and ValuePricing, which will retrieve data from a server external to the RLCS network, are not considered users.
2189	1	a	Also, the driving public will have access to system status via the changeable message signs, and eventually the Traveler Information Network, but are also not considered users of the system.
2190	1	a	User Class Operator Management Field Maintenance Staff Electrical Systems (Hardware) Software Systems (Software) System Administrator Functions Command control of the system during normal mode.
2191	1	a	Only one ?operator? may be logged onto the system at any given time.

2199	0	a	Authorized to changed system mode.
2200	0	a	Security setup capabilities are defined in more detail in Section 3.
2201	0	a	Constraints The following constraints were factors in the development of the detailed requirements for the.
2202	0	a	RLCS Application: a) Regulatory policies ? There were no technical regulatory policies specifically covering the RLCS Application.
2203	0	a	b) Hardware limitations ? The RLCS Application will reside on a hardware platform compatible with Microsoft Windows NT or Unix-based operating systems.
2204	0	a	c) Interfaces to other applications ? Other than system level interfaces, such as network, operating system, and database system, there will be no interfaces to other applications.
2205	1	a	e) Audit functions ? The RLCS Application will create and store log files which will track all I-15 RLCS Software Requirements Specification application activity.
2206	0	a	f) Higher-order language requirements ? There are no specific high level language requirements, other than that a high level language be used to develop and maintain the RLCS Application for more cost-effective maintenance efforts.
2207	0	a	g) Reliability requirements ? The RLCS Application must be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.
2208	0	a	h) Criticality of the application ? The RLCS Application is important to the traffic management goals of the Southern California region.
2209	0	a	Opening the lanes in the direction of the peak traffic flow to route traffic onto the reversible lanes is a critical operation in meeting these goals.
2210	0	a	i) Safety and security considerations ? The safety of field maintenance staff and the traveling public is dependent on the correct functioning of the RLCS Application to open and close the facility.
2211	0	a	Should this type of event actually occur, it would be nothing less than catastrophic; for the motorists involved; for the traveling public in general, for the system operators, and for the Agency.
2212	0	a	Another potential control system risk, lies with the barrier gates used at Locations 1, 2, and 5.
2213	0	a	Should one of these gates be lowered across an otherwise open entrance, the results could be catastrophic.
2214	0	a	There are less serious, but possibly more common control system risks in closure device/sensor failures during the opening or closing of an entrance.
2215	0	a	In the absence of full system overrides, if the system allows, or causes, an entrance to be opened in one direction, when an entrance in the opposite direction is open, then the system has failed.
2216	0	a	A well designed, carefully implemented, and thoroughly tested control system, can reduce the chance of such an occurrence (due to operator error, control system or sensor failure).
2217	0	a	In order to achieve this, the nature of the risk must be understood and continually kept in mind by control system developers and testers.
2218	0	a	Assumptions and dependencies The RLCS will benefit from the deployment of the Fiber Optic Network along I-15 Reversible Lane corridor to include the RLCS lanes.
2219	0	a	The communications between the FCU and DCU locations will continue to be copper.
2220	0	a	The primary mode of communication is fiber and secondary is ISDN.
2221	0	a	The fail over will be transparent to the RLCS application.
2222	0	a	A dialup connection will be used for remote access to the RLCS.
2223	0	a	Apportioning of the requirements The RLCS software will not be apportioned, or split between multiple releases.
2224	0	a	The complete set of requirements will be included in one release.
2225	0	a	Specific Requirements This section of the SRS contains the RLCS Application software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design the system, and acceptance testers to test that the system satisfies the requirements.
2226	0	a	This will be done before high-level software design phase.
2227	1	a	Every stated requirement is externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems.
2228	0	a	This section describes each input into the software, every output from the software, and all functions performed by the software.
2229	1	a	Hardware Interfaces Multiple field devices will interface with updated device input/output cards that in turn will interface with an intelligent controller.
2230	1	a	It is unknown at this time which particular controller will be used to control the field devices, but the software must interface with whichever controller is chosen to interface with the field devices.
2231	0	a	The field devices and controllers in the table on the following page are currently in use at the facility.
2232	0	a	See Appendix D for a table of current FCU-DCU and FCU-CMS interface pin configurations.

2448	0	a	This document is under NDA with the SCE-API consortium.
2449	0	a	This document describes a proposal for a standard C/C++ modeling interface for emulators and other veri?cation platforms.
2450	0	a	The interface provides multiple communication channels between software models running on a host workstation and a device under test (DUT) represented as a structural hardware netlist running on a veri?cation platform such as an emulator.
2451	0	a	Existing standard veri?cation interfaces were designed to meet the needs of design teams of over 10 years ago.
2452	0	a	A new type of interface is needed to meet the veri?cation challenges of the next 10 years.
2453	0	a	This document is a proposal for a multichannel communication interface that addresses these challenges.
2454	0	a	This new interface must cater to the needs of both emulation end users and emulation suppliers. Emulation Customer Problems to be Solved by SCE-API 0
2455	0	a	All emulators on the market today have proprietary APIs.
2456	0	a	The proliferation of APIs makes it very di?icult for software-based veri?cation products to port to the different emulators, thus restricting the solutions available to customers.
2457	0	a	This also leads to low productivity and low return on investment (ROI) for emulator customers who build their own solutions. 0
2458	0	a	APIs? which exist today are oriented to gate-level and not system-level veri?cation. 0
2459	0	a	This document is directed to members of the Standard Co-Emula?on API (SCE-API) technical committee.
2460	0	a	The committee members represent a consortium of EDA customers and EDA tool suppliers dedicated to the creation of a breakthrough high?performance common emulation API.
2461	0	a	The founding participants in the consortium are AptiX, CoWare, Ikos Systems, Mentor Graphics, ST Microelectronics, Synopsys, and TransEDA.
2462	0	a	The scope of this document shall be restricted to what is speci?cally referred to herein as the Standard Co-Emulation AP]: Modeling Interface (SCE-MI).
2463	0	a	This modeling interface is intended to be one of possibly several parts making up the whole SCE-API standard.
2464	0	a	In the future, SCE-API may be expanded to include additional parts to handle such features as debug and control, code coverage, etc.
2465	0	a	This document is intended to describe an overall use model of the SCE-MI, a tutorial illustrating this use model, and a formal functional speci?cation of the SCE-MI API itself.
2466	0	a	Future revisions of the document will continue to re?ect the feedback from members of the SCE-API technical committee.
2467	0	a	Added clari?cation to how the g () function works with : :ServiceLOOp ( ), added note about memory allocation and deletion, added : :ReplaceBindi ing ()

2478	0	a	Each communication channel is designed to transport untimed messages of arbitrary abstraction between its two end points or ?ports? of a channel.
2479	0	a	These message channels are not meant to connect software models to each other but rather to connect software proxy models to message port interfaces on the hardware side of the design.
2480	0	a	The means to interconnect software models to each other must be provided by a software modeling and simulation environment such as SystemC which is beyond the scope of this document.
2481	0	a	This can be summarized with the following recommendations regarding the API: 0 Do not use it to bridge event based or sub?cycle accurate simulation environments 0
2482	0	a	It is possible but not ideal to bridge cycle accurate simulation environments 0
2483	0	a	It is ideal for bridging an untimed simulation environment with a cycle accurate simulation environment There are many references in the document to SystemC as the modeling environment for untimed software models.
2484	0	a	This is because, although SystemC is capable of modeling at the cycle accurate RTL abstraction level, it is also considered ideally suited for untimed modeling.
2485	0	a	As such, it has been chosen for use in many of the examples in this document.
2486	0	a	While the software side of the described interface is generic in its ability to be used in any C/C++ modeling environment, it is optimized to be compatible with SystemC (see reference [1]).
2487	0	a	Similarly, its hardware side is optimized to prevent undue throttling of an emulator during a co-modeling session run.
2488	0	a	Throughout this document the term emulation or emulator is used to denote a structural or RTL model of a DUT running in an emulator, rapid prototype, or other simulation environment including software HDL simulators.
2489	0	a	Such bottlenecks could severely compromise the performance of an emulator which is otherwise very fast.
2490	0	a	Similarly, it can take thousands of clocked events on the hardware side to generate the content of a message on a channel originating from the hardware that is ultimately destined for an untimed software model. Document Layout

2496	0	a	The SCE-MI provides a transport infrastructure between the emulator and host workstation sides of each channel, that interconnects transactor models in the emulator to C (untimed or RTL) models on the workstation.
2497	0	a	Again it is important to note that for purposes of this document, the term emulator can be used interchangeably with any simulator capable of executing RTL or gate-level models, including software HDL simulators.
2498	0	a	These interconnects are provided in the form of message channels that run between the software side and the hardware side of the SCE-MI infrastructure.
2499	0	a	Each message channel has two ends.
2500	0	a	The end on the software side is called a message port proxy which is a C++ obj ect that gives API access to the channel.
2501	0	a	The end on the hardware side is a message port macro that is instantiated inside a transactor and connected to other components in the transactor.
2502	0	a	Each message channel is either an input or an output channel with respect to the hardware side.
2503	0	a	It is important to note that message channels are not unidirectional or bidirectional busses in the sense of hardware signals, but are rather more like network sockets that use message passing protocols.
2504	0	a	It is the job of the transactors to serve as abstraction gaskets that decompose messages arriving on input channels from the software side into sequences of cycle accurate events that are to be clocked into the DUT.
2505	0	a	This allows the transactor to ?freeze? controlled time while performing message composition and decomposition operations. Support for Multi-Threaded Environments
2506	0	a	The SCE-MI is designed to couple easily with multi-threaded environments such as SystemC, yet it also functions just as easily in single-threaded environments such as simple C programs.
2507	0	a	A special service [0017 function (see section 4.3.3.6 on page 68) is provided by the SCE-MI that can be called from an application to give the SCE-MI infrastructure an opportunity to service its communication channels.
2508	0	a	It is inside this function that queued up input messages can be sent to the hardware side and arriving output messages can be dispatched to the appropriate software models.
2509	0	a	A maj or goal of this speci?cation is to address the needs of three target audiences, each with a distinct interest in their use of the interface.
2510	0	a	The target audiences are as follows:
2511	0	a	While end users might be aware of the need for a ?gasket? that bridges these two levels of abstraction, they want the creation of these abstraction bridges to be as painless and automated as possible.
2512	0	a	Ideally, the end users are not required to be familiar with the details of SCE-MI API.
2513	0	a	Rather, on the hardware side, they might wish to rely on the transactor implementor (see next section) to provide prede?ned transactor models that can directly interface to their DUT.
2514	0	a	Additionally, the transactor implementor can supply proxy models on the software side that provide untimed ?sockets? to the transactors.
2515	0	a	2.2.3 SCE-MI Infrastructure Implementor
2516	0	a	The SCE-MI infrastructure implementor is interested in furnishing a working implementation of an SCE-MI that runs on some vendor supplied veri?cation platform (probably their own).
2517	0	a	Such a con?guration can be used to test a processor DUT that has some communications interfaces that can include an ethemet adapter, PCI interface, and a USB interface.
2518	0	a	Once we do this however, we might still want to test them with the unaltered, untimed testbench models.
2519	0	a	The SCE-MI infrastructure performs the task of serving as a transport layer that guarantees delivery of messages back and forth between the message port proxy and message port ends of each channel.
2520	0	a	Messages arriving on input channels are presented to the transactors through message inputports.
2521	0	a	In fact, the testbench models do not know that the messages have actually come from and gone to a totally different abstraction level.
2522	0	a	The DUT input proxies have the job of accepting untimed messages from various C models and sending them to the message input port proxies for transport to the hardware side.
2523	0	a	The DUT output proxies establish callbacks that monitor the message output port proxies for arrival of messages from the hardware side.
2524	0	a	Rather, they can be considered arbitrary data types ranging in abstraction from a simple bit, boolean or integer, on up to something as complex as a C++ class or even some aggregate of objects.
2525	0	a	It is in this form that messages can be transported either by value or by reference over abstract ports between fully untimed software models of the sort described in Figure 2 and, in substantially more detail in reference [1].
2526	0	a	However, before messages can be transported over an SCE-MI message channel, their content must be serialized into a large bit vector by the DUT proxy model.
2527	0	a	Conversely, after a message arrives on a message output channel and is dispatched to a DUT output proxy model, it might be de-serialized back into an abstract C++ data type.
2528	0	a	At this point, it is ready for presentation at the abstract output ports (to use SystemC terminology) of the DUT proxy to the connected software testbench models.
2529	0	a	Meanwhile, on the hardware side, a message arriving on the message input channel can trigger many dozens to hundreds of clocks of event activity.
2530	0	a	It is the job of the transactor to perform this decomposition of message data content to sequences of clocked events that are presented to the DUT hardware model inputs.
2531	0	a	Note that, for the most part, the term message can be used interchangeably with transaction.
2532	0	a	But if they are shown for all cycles of the uncontrolledclock, the waveforms would appear more like the uncontrolled time View shown in Figure 4.
2533	0	a	In this View, the controlled clock is suspended or disabled and the DUT is ?
2534	0	a	? Suppose a system has multiple controlled clocks (of possibly differing frequencies) and multiple transactors controlling them.
2535	0	a	Any one of these transactors has the option of stopping any clock.
2536	0	a	If this happens, all controlled clocks in the system stop in unison.
2537	0	a	Furthermore, all other transactors that did not themselves stop the clock, must still sense that the clocks were globally stopped and continue to function correctly even though they themselves had no need to stop the clock.
2538	0	a	A transactor might need to stop the controlled clock when performing operations that involve decomposition or composition of transactions arriving from, or going to a message channel. 0
2539	0	a	All transactors are clocked by a free running uncontrolled clock that is provided by the SCE-MI hardware side infrastructure.
2540	0	a	The models to be run on the workstation are compiled using a common C/C++ compiler or possibly obtained from other sources such as third party vendors in the form of IP, ISS simulators, etc.
2541	0	a	The compiled models are linked with the software side of the SCE-MI infrastructure to form an executable program.
2542	0	a	Part of this compile process can involve adding additional structure to the bridge netlist, that properly interfaces the user supplied netlist to the SCE-MI infrastructure implementation components.
2543	0	a	Put more simply, the infrastructure linker is responsible for providing the core of the SCE-MI interface macros on the hardware side.
2544	0	a	Among the parameters it analyzes are the following:
2545	0	a	The software executable compiled and linked in the software compilation phase is now executed which causes all the software models to be constructed in the workstation process image space.
2546	0	a	Once this binding occurs, the co-modeling session can proceed.
2547	0	a	SCE-MI Interface Components
2548	0	a	The SCE-MI run time environment consists of a set of interface components on both the hardware side and the software side of the interface, each of which provides a distinct level of functionality.
2549	0	a	They are introduced in this section, and each is discussed in more detail later in this document. Hardware Side Interface Components
2550	0	a	The interface components presented by the SCE-MI hardware side consist of a small set of macros that provide connection points between the transactors and the SCE-MI infrastructure.
2551	0	a	These compactly de?ned and simple to use macros fully present all necessary aspects of the interface to the transactors and the DUT.
2552	0	a	From the point of View of this speci?cation, these macros are simply represented as empty Verilog or VHDL models with clearly de?ned port and parameter interfaces.
2553	0	a	This is analogous to a software API speci?cation that de?nes function prototypes of the API calls without showing their implementations.
2554	0	a	The macros are parametrized such that, at the point of instantiation, crucial parameters that will dictate the dimensions of the SCE-MI bridge to software can be easily speci?ed by the user.
2555	0	a	It is the job of the in?astmcture linker to learn the values of these parameters and customize implementation components inserted underneath the macros accordingly.
2556	0	a	Any number of these macros can be instantiated as is required by the system.
2557	1	a	One SceMiMessageInPort macro must be instantiated for each required message input channel, and one SceMiMessageOutPort macro for each output channel.
2558	0	a	Message port macro bit-widths are parametrized at the point of instantiation.
2559	0	a	Exactly one SceMiClockPort macro is instantiated for each de?ned clock in the system.
2560	1	a	This SceMiClockPort macro instance will, Via a set of parameters, fully characterize a particular clock.
2561	1	a	The SceMiClockPort macro is instantiated at the top level and provides a controlled clock and reset directly to the DUT.
2562	1	a	The SceMiClockPort macro instance is named and assigned a reference ClockNum parameter that is used to associate it with one or more counterpart SceMiClockControl macros inside one or more transactors.
2563	1	a	The SceMiClockControl macro is used by its transactor for all clock controlling operations for its associated clock.
2564	1	a	These two macros are mutually associated by the ClockNum parameter and every SceMiClockPort macro must have a minimum of one SceMiClockControl macro associated with it.
2565	0	a	Connection of SCE-MI Macros on Hardware Side to Transactor and DUT ul
2566	0	a	This example features a single transactor interacting with a DUT and interfacing to the software side through a SceMiMessageInPort and a SceMiMessageOutPort.
2567	0	a	In addition, it de?nes a single clock that is controlled by the transactor internally using the SceMiClockControl macro.
2568	0	a	This clock drives the DUT from the top level through a SceMiClockPort macro.
2569	0	a	Because the transactor encapsulates the message port macros and the SceMiClockControl macro, the end user only has to be aware of how to hook up to the transactor itself and to the SceMiClockPort macro.
2570	0	a	The SceMiClockPort macro instantiation is where all the clock parameters are speci?ed.
2571	0	a	This tutorial tries to illustrate how the use model of the SCE-MI can be applied in a multi- threaded SystemC environment.
2572	0	a	It assumes some familiarity with the concepts of SystemC including abstractports, autonomous threads, slave threads, module and port de?nition, and module instantiation and interconnect.
2573	0	a	The Routed design is a small design that simulates air passengers traveling from Origins to Destinations by traversing various interconnected Pipes and Hubs in a RouteMap.
2574	0	a	In this design, the Origins and Destinations are the transactors and the RouteMap model is the DUT. Each Origin transactor interfaces to a SceMiMessageInPort to gain access to messages aniving from the software side.
2575	0	a	Each Destination transactor interfaces to a SceMiMessageOutPort to send messages to the software side.
2576	0	a	There is also an OrigDest module that has both an Origin and Destination transactor contained within it.
2577	0	a	The numbers shown by the directed arcs are the travel time (in hours) to travel the indicated Pipe. Layover time in each Hub is two hours.
2578	1	a	The RouteMap is initialized by injecting TeachRoute messages for the entire system through the Waltham Origin transactor.
2579	0	a	In other words, by ?rst teaching closer hubs.
2580	1	a	This process continues until the entire mesh is initialized, at which point it is ready to serve as a backbone for all air travel activity.
2581	0	a	After initiating the route con?guration, the testbench then executes the itineraries of 4 passengers over a period of 22 days.
2582	0	a	Each itinerary consists of several legs, each with scheduled departure from a speci?ed Origin and each with a speci?ed Destination.
2583	1	a	The scheduled leg is sent as a message token to its designated Origin transactor.
2584	0	a	It is the job of the transactor to count the number of clocks until the speci?ed departure time before sending the token into the RouteMap mesh. 3.2.2 System Hierarchy
2585	0	a	The hierarchy of the whole system is textually shown in the following subsections.
2586	0	a	Note that the interactions shown between the Calendar and Scheduler software side models and the OrigDest, Origin, and Destination hardware side models.
2587	0	a	Encapsulated within the Origin and Destination transactors are the SceMiMessageInPort, SceMiMessageOutPort, and SceMiClockControl macros.
2588	0	a	Notice that this diagram more or less follows the structure of the generalized abstraction bridge shown in Figure 3 on page 11.
2589	0	a	The two software models that interact with the hardware side are the Calendar model and the Scheduler model.
2590	0	a	These models encapsulate message port proxies which give them direct access to the message channels leading to the Origin and Destination transactors on the hardware side.
2591	0	a	These two software models are the only ones that are aware of the SCE-MI link.
2592	0	a	They converse with the other models through SystemC abstract ports.
2593	0	a	On the hardware side, there is a set of Origin and Destination transactors that service the message channels that interface with the Scheduler and route tokens to or from the DUT.
2594	0	a	Some locations, such as Anchorage and the UK, are both Origin and Destination (called OrigDest). Functional Requirements Speci?cation: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI) 23 of 94 User?s Guide and Tutorial
2595	0	a	In addition, there is a ClockAdvancer transactor that interfaces directly with the Calendar model.
2596	0	a	Each received token is passed to the TokenOut port when the scheduled departure time has matured.
2597	0	a	Although the Origin transactor has a clock control macro, it does not actively control the clock.
2598	0	a	Its only use of the clock control macro is to monitor the ReadyForCclock signal to know on which uclocks the cclock is active so that it can properly count cclocks until the scheduled departure time of a pending departure token.
2599	0	a	Each Destination transactor contains a clock control macro and a message output port macro to send arrival tokens back to the Scheduler on the software side.
2600	0	a	The arrival tokens represent a passenger emerging from the RouteMap mesh and arriving at a Destination through its TokenIn port.
2601	0	a	This transactor was chosen to be described in detail because it provides a simple example of clock control and message port interfacing.
2602	0	a	Normally, OS are clocked through the mesh so if, on any given cycle, a Hub or Destination senses a non?O value on its input port, it knows it has received a token that needs to be processed. Token formats are also shown in Figure 9.
2603	0	a	A departure token contains the passenger ID, destination ID, and scheduled time of departure.
2604	0	a	As the departure token travels through the mesh, it collects layover information consisting of the IDs of all the Hubs encountered before reaching its Destination, having been transformed into an arrival token.
2605	0	a	The arrival token then has a complete record of layover information that is passed back to the software side and displayed to the console.
2606	0	a	A Hub consists of a Funnel that accepts tokens from up to four different sources, and a Nozzle that routes a token up to four different destinations.
2607	0	a	The Nozzle contains a small RouteTable that is initialized at the beginning of the simulation with routing information by receiving TeachRoute tokens. 3.2.3.4
2608	0	a	The Destination transactor accepts tokens arriving from a point-of?eXit on the Rout eMap and passes them to the message output port.
2609	0	a	The Destination transactor uses clock control to avoid losing potentially successive tokens arriving from the RouteMap (through the TokenIn input) to this destination portal.
2610	0	a	It de-asseits the readyForCclock in the event that a token comes in, but the message output port is not able to take it because of tokens simultaneously arriving at other destination portals.
2611	0	a	This way, it guarantees that the entire Rout eMap is disabled until all tokens are olf-loaded from the requesting Destination transactors.
2612	0	a	In fact there is only one cclock in the entire system that is speci?ed at the default 1/1 ratio. Notice also that, although the ClockAdvancer handshakes with the message output port, the data that it sends is always 0.
2613	0	a	The software side of the Routed design is written completely in SystemC and C++.
2614	0	a	It is compiled as an executable program that links with the SCE-MI software side.
2615	0	a	3.2.4.1 The System Model: Interconnect 0f SystemC Modules
2616	0	a	The System model is the top level ?software netlist? of SystemC modules ( sciMODULE () ).
2617	0	a	It speci?es the construction and interconnect of the component models as well.
2618	0	a	These can be thought of as abstract signals that interconnect abstract ports.
2619	0	a	The parametrized data type associated with each scilinkimp<> denotes the data type of the message that the channel is capable of transferring from an output abstract port to an input abstract port.
2620	0	a	However, passing messages by reference is more ef?cient but care must be taken in their use.
2621	0	a	After each child module is constructed, its abstract ports are mapped to one of the declared interconnect channels.
2622	0	a	It is important to stress that SystemC channels, while conceptually the same, are distinctly di?erent from SCE-MI message channels.
2623	1	a	Both types of channels pass messages, but SystemC channels are designed strictly to pass messages of arbitrary C++ data types between SystemC modules.
2624	0	a	An entire simulation can be built of j ust software models communicating with each other.
2625	0	a	See reference [1] for more details about SystemC interconnect channels.
2626	1	a	SCE-MI message channels have a completely different interface and are optimized for implementing abstraction bridges between a software subsystem and a hardware subsystem.
2627	1	a	These two threads are the only autonomous threads in the system.
2628	1	a	All the other code is executed inside slave threads.
2629	1	a	The ?rst routine de?ned is the errorHandler () .
2630	1	a	This is the master error handling function that is registered with the SCE-MI.
2631	1	a	This method returns a pointer to an SceMi obj ect that manages the whole SCE-MI software side infrastructure.
2632	0	a	Next the System model described in the previous section is constructed.
2633	1	a	The -1 parameter tells it to go inde?nitely until the program decides to end.
2634	0	a	How the program ends is explained in the next section.
2635	0	a	The SceMiDispatcher Module:
2636	0	a	Interfacing with the SCE-MI Service Loop
2637	0	a	The SceMiDi spatcher module contains an autonomous thread that yields to the SCE-MI infrastructure so that it may service its message port proxies, by making repeated calls to the SceMi: :ServiceLoop () method (see section 4.3.3.6 on page 68).
2638	0	a	By placing this logic on its own dedicated thread, other models in the system do not have to worry about yielding to the SCE-MI. 34 of 94 Functional Requirements Speci?cation: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI)
2639	0	a	Between each call to the service loop, the autonomous thread yields to other threads in the system by calling the wait () function.
2640	0	a	Actually, the only other autonomous thread in the Routed system is the one in the Testbench model.
2641	0	a	Both of these threads are represented by the thick round arrows in Figure 10 on page 30.
2642	1	a	The other job of the SceMiDi spatcher is shut down the system when it detects a noti?cation on its Done port that the simulation is complete.
2643	0	a	It will later be used as a base for the extension of the existing software itself.
2644	0	a	This document follows the IEEE standard for software requirements specification documents.
2645	0	a	PDF is the most popular file format for secure, dependable electronic information exchange.
2646	0	a	It is used by more than half billion people and has become one of the world?s most trusted technologies.
2647	0	a	PDF files can be viewed from almost any platform (Macintosh?, Windows?, UNIX? and LINUX? as well as numerous mobile platforms and devices) but the manipulation of these files is not usually free.
2648	0	a	The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way to handle pdf files efficiently and free through a simple graphical interface.
2649	0	a	1.2 Document Conventions PDF Split and Merge was created prior to this document, so all requirements stated here are already satisfied.
2650	0	a	It is very important to update this document with every future requirement and clarify its priority for consistency purposes, so that this document can remain useful.
2651	0	a	Because of the fact that PDFsam is already implemented, parts of this document have a style similar to a manual document.
2652	0	a	Some technical information has been included.
2653	0	a	Readers can refer to Appendix A at the end of the document for terms definition (glossary).

2658	0	a	The GUI provides the user with all the functionality needed to handle a PDF file (or more files together).
2659	0	a	The functionalities are distributed in plugins.
2660	0	a	Each plugin performs a specific function and loads in the main GUI.
2661	0	a	In the basic version, the GUI contains six plugins: - Alternate Mix - Merge/Extract - Rotate - Split - Visual document composer - Visual reorder This is a picture of a plugin of PDFsam The Console is a command-line application.

2663	0	a	Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective PDF Split and Merge is a multi functional tool for manipulating pdf files.
2664	0	a	It is free and open source with a GNU General Public License (GPL).
2665	0	a	Although there are many programs for viewing pdfs, there is not any program to handle pdfs with so many features as PDFsam.
2666	0	a	The fact that it is open source is an extra motive for the users who have the knowledge to help with the project?s development.
2667	0	a	In addition, there is also an enhanced version of the software that provides even more capabilities.

2670	0	a	2.3 User Classes and Characteristics This project refers to several types of users of any computer system.
2671	0	a	However, this project is meant to be used by two major user classes: 1.
2672	0	a	General users who can use the software to cover specific needs: - People of all age groups without much experience because the PDFsam interface is pleasant and user friendly and its functions are relatively simple.
2673	0	a	Open source software developers and contributors: - Software Developers: People with very good knowledge of programming language project, in order to understand and be able to extend project?s source code.

2678	0	a	PDFsam is GNU GPLv2 licensed and the PDFsam-console is dual licensed (GPLv2 and LGPLv2).
2679	0	a	Everyone, that does or is going to develop or use PDFsam, should agree and fully accept the terms of this kind of license.
2680	0	a	2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies A working Java Runtime Environment version 1.6 or above is necessary.
2681	0	a	System Features PDFsam consists of a number of plugins which constitute its basic functions, and some additional features that make the whole process easier and faster.
2682	0	a	All plugins are located in the ?plugins tree? on the left side of the GUI Interface.
2683	0	a	This section describes the functional requirements of the application and the features it provides.
2684	0	a	System features are described in detail to help the future extension and testing of the system.
2685	0	a	Features stated here are already parts of the implemented system so no prioritization is needed.
2686	0	a	Priority is needed for features to be developed that will be added to this document later.
2687	1	a	3.1 System Feature 1 - Split Split a pdf document through the GUI Interface.
2688	1	a	This plugin allows you to set a number of options that will be used to split the document.
2689	1	a	3.1.1 Description The user can divide a pdf document into parts, following some options for how to split the document.
2690	1	a	Then he can save the output pdf files in a directory he wants.
2691	1	a	3.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences The user has to select the Split option from the plugins tree (or press the ?S? key) to display the split panel.
2692	0	a	This is a screenshot of the Split plugin The GUI Split panel consists of the following parts: ? Selection panel: The user selects the document he wants to split from a directory.
2693	1	a	When the file is imported, some information about the file displayed (such as pages number, pdf version?).
2694	1	a	If the document is protected the user have to enter the password to the appropriate field and then reload the pdf.
2695	1	a	? Split options: The user can choose between 7 types of splitting: - Burst: the input file will be split in single pages.
2696	1	a	- Split at this size: the input file will be split in files of the given size (roughly).
2697	1	a	- Split by bookmark level: the input file will be split at every page linked by the bookmarks of the selected level (this can be very useful if you want to split an e-book in chapters).
2698	1	a	? Destination folder: The user selects the destination folder for the output files (specific or same as source).
2699	1	a	Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.
2700	1	a	? Output options: Here the user can define a pattern that will generate filenames for the output files.
2701	1	a	The available complex prefixes that can be used are: - [CURRENTPAGE]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with the current page number.
2702	1	a	The number of digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of ?#? at the prefix name, inside the square brackets (e.g.
2703	0	a	the prefix [CURRENTPAGE###] will generate prefixes like ?001?, ?002?...).
2704	1	a	- [TIMESTAMP]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with the current date and time.
2705	1	a	Time has milliseconds precision and the replaced variable will be something like ?20100206_045107232? that is ?YYYYMMDD_HHmmssSSS?.
2706	1	a	- [FILENUMBER]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with a file number according to the output order.
2707	1	a	The number of digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of '#' at the prefix name, inside the square brackets (e.g.
2708	1	a	It does not ensure unique output filenames and it must be used together with other variables.
2709	1	a	If it is used alone, the system will use the default filename pattern.

3110	0	a	1.3 Proj ect Scope As part of the Conseivation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), twelve ARS Benchmark Watersheds will support watershed-scale assessment of environmental effects of USDA conservation program implementation.
3111	0	a	The ARS Benchmark Watersheds represent primaiily rainfed cropland, although some of the watersheds also contain irrigated cropland, grazingland, wetlands, and confined animal feeding operations.
3112	0	a	Three additional ARS watersheds may be added in the future to represent additional land uses.
3113	0	a	Environmental effects and bene?ts will be estimated primarily for water and soil resources, with some assessment of wildlife habitat and air quality benefits in some watersheds.
3114	1	a	The basic requirement for STEWARDS is to deliver consistent high quality data in support of the CEAP watershed-scale assessment from a one-stop data portal to the CEAP Clients and, in time, the public at large.
3115	1	a	The data system consists two main parts -- a central database management system for the storage and management of data, and a client application to allow users access and interact with the data.
3116	1	a	The data stored in the database can be Viewed and downloaded using graphical and tabular interface tools.
3117	1	a	The data system will serve as a repository where diverse end-users can access, search, analyze, Visualize, and report various types of integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations.
3118	1	a	Types of data will be diverse, including biophysical data (i.e., point-based in time and/or space, spatially variable data, time series), data about land use, management, and conservation practices; and economic data.
3119	0	a	The intention of the team is that ARS researchers at watershed locations retain primary responsibility for data collection and management.
3120	1	a	Sites may chose to retain existing data management protocols or change location protocols to those of STEWARDS.
3121	1	a	However, STEWARDS must have the capability to translate data from location-specific formats into the standardized STEWARDS formats.
3122	1	a	Data on STEWARDS will not be available to the public in real time.
3123	1	a	Access to real-time data will remain at the discretion of each location research team.
3124	0	a	Instead, annual or more frequent updates from location databases to STEWARDS will be made by the watersheds? staffs after the locations have completed their quality assurance procedures.
3125	0	a	This product is a new, centralized data system.
3126	1	a	Source data for this system are the long-terrn ARS watersheds, with those participating in the CEAP project expected to participate in this data system first.
3127	1	a	2.2 Product Features The data system consists two main parts -- a central database management system for the uploading, storage, and management of data, and a client application to allow users access and interact with the data.
3128	1	a	Diverse end-users can access, search, analyze, Visualize, download, and report various types of integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations.
3129	1	a	Types of data will include biophysical data (i.e., point-based in time and/or space, spatially variable data, time series), data about land use, management, and conservation practices; and economic data.
3130	0	a	System operator: Staff at OCIO responsible for maintaining executable code, requiring full access to all aspects of the system.
3131	0	a	Data operations manager: Staff, probably at OCIO, responsible for data archiving and maintenance, requiring read/write/modify privileges to all data in the system.
3132	0	a	This includes the role commonly thought of as a Database Administrator (DBA).
3133	0	a	Watershed uploaders: Staff in the watersheds who have responsibility to upload local data requiring write access to space allocated to their specific watershed.
3134	0	a	ARS users: ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes.
3135	0	a	These would likely be conversant with the general characteristics of the data content, and to a lesser extent have abilities manipulating Views of the data using database tools such as envisioned for this database system.
3136	1	a	These users will need user/password authentication to enable user settings management and to have access to data protected through the confidentiality agreements among agencies participating in CEAP.
3137	0	a	Research users: Non?ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes.
3138	0	a	These would have similar characteristics and needs as ARS users, but because of the agency-level confidentiality issues, could not access the password-protected sensitive data.
3139	0	a	Public users: Eventual release of the database system to the general public will add university and agency researchers who would appear similar in training to the primary users, but also would add clients with the entire range of training and interests.
3140	1	a	These users would have access to the public data without need for authentication.
3141	1	a	2.4 Operating Environment The rule for selecting hardware and software is that the components/application must be functionally efficient, capable of interfacing with other software, and easy to maintain.
3142	1	a	The System shall operate with the following Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and 6.0, Netscape Communicator version 4.7, Netscape versions 6 and 7, and FireFOX.

3145	1	a	The Data Research and Reporting portion of the system shall provide public access to reViewed and approved data sets.
3146	1	a	Therefore, the web applications will be implemented to run on the server side as much as possible.
3147	1	a	Also, it is required to test the application using different platforms, connection speeds, screen settings, colors/graphics, and browsers.
3148	0	a	Portability: The application codes generated during prototyping may not run properly when re-hosting the data system to a non-Windows OS or transferring the data system to another location.
3149	0	a	Data uploading and management will likely be done as infrequently as once a year.
3150	0	a	This fact greatly limits the complexity of the user interface and the learning curve needed for completing this task.
3151	1	a	system shall use the current corporate standard Microsoft SQL Server database engine.
3152	1	a	The system shall be in compliance with all Accessibility, Web Design, and Security policies applicable.
3153	0	a	As part of standard operating procedures, a testing plan will be documented during the Design phase.

3274	1	a	The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.
3275	0	a	SCR?4: Availability The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability.
3276	1	a	The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not less than 50% of working hours in any week).
3277	1	a	For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components.
3278	0	a	Intentional ?denial of service attacks? is not foreseen as a significant concern.
3279	1	a	5.4 Software Quality Attributes SQ-l: Portability This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments.
3280	1	a	SQ-2: Adaptability Implementation of the application software/code and design of database stmcture should be ?exible enough for the necessary change in the later phase.

3682	1	a	4.2. lFunctions The FSW has the following primary functions: 0 Process science data from the camera and relay it to the Spacecraft Control Unit (SCU) in the form of CCSDS Source Packets.
3683	1	a	0 Receive commands from the SCU that establish the current instrument state and camera mode.

3687	1	a	4.2.20bservation Sequence The XRT supports three different, but very similar, observation sequences.
3688	1	a	The three observation types are: 0 Automatic 0 Preplanned 0 Target of Opportunity Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a detailed ?owchart for the observation types.
3689	0	a	The sequence shown in the ?gures assumes the software is in automatic mode and not presently engaged in performing an observation.
3690	1	a	The sequence starts when a SISCATTITUDE message is received with the IS7SETTLED indication set to false.
3691	1	a	The message also indicates 1S71N7107ARCMIN, which is true when the S/C is within ten arc minutes of the target position.
3692	1	a	When the distance remaining to slew is greater than ten arc minutes, the S/C begins the ?rst of up to three activities that precede an observation.
3693	1	a	Each activity is initiated when the distance remaining is greater than ten arc minutes and the previous activity is complete.
3694	0	a	One frame is acquired for the row bias map.
3695	0	a	Once the frame has been acquired, the software recalculates and stores the updated row bias map.
3696	0	a	Next, the software recalculates the image bias map, if more than ten arc minutes remain to the target location.
3697	1	a	The software accumulates 3-6 frames for the recalculation of the row bias map.
3698	1	a	Otherwise, the eXisting image bias map is reused.
3699	0	a	Finally, if the acquire raw data image ?ag is true and the distance to the target location is more than ten arc minutes, then the software acquires a single raw data image which is saved for later download to the ground.
3700	0	a	At this point, the S/C has come to within ten arc minutes of the target or the observation preliminary activities are complete, and the software switches to the fast timing mode.
3701	1	a	When the SISCATTITUDE message indicates that the S/C is settled, the software starts the main portion of the observation sequence.
3702	0	a	The software now acquires a frame of data and begins counting the pixels above a detection threshold.
3703	0	a	To be considered of interest, this count of pixels must exceed a programmable threshold.
3704	0	a	If the count does not exceed the threshold, then another image is acquired and summed with the ?rst image.
3705	0	a	This new image is subjected to the pixel count.
3706	0	a	This process continues until the count threshold is met or the timeout period is exceeded.
3707	1	a	If the timeout is exceeded, an ?XRT Centroid Error? message is transmitted to UVOT and to the ground (Via TDRSS).
3708	1	a	Otherwise, when the source is detected, the software performs a centroid calculation on the image.
3709	1	a	If the centroid calculation fails, an ?XRT Centroid Error? message is sent; otherwise, an ?XRT Position? message is sent.
3710	0	a	Next, the software enters the fast timing mode.
3711	0	a	In this mode, the CCD reports a single value representing the entire image.
3712	1	a	The CCD reports one pixel every 16 usec, or approximately 60,000 pixels/sec.
3713	1	a	The software remains in this mode while the lit pixel rate exceeds 40 cps.
3714	1	a	Once the count falls below 40 cps, the software switches to normal timing mode.
3715	1	a	In this mode, the CCD reports one row every 5 msec.
3716	1	a	Each row report sums up the CCD columns.
3717	1	a	This method is used until the rate drops below 2 cps.
3718	1	a	At this point, the software switches to photon counting mode.
3719	1	a	In this mode, the entire image is collected and scanned for lit pixels.
3720	0	a	The update rate is approximately once every 2.5 sec.
3721	1	a	The observation sequence ends when the target is occulted and the S/C slews to a new target.
3722	1	a	Preplanned observations differ from automatic ones in that the ?XRT Position? message is not used.
3723	0	a	Processing is otherwise similar.
3724	0	a	The target of opportunity observations are treated like preplanned observations from an operational point of View of the software.

3778	0	a	4.2.3Interfaces and Performance Estimates of the maximum amount of memory required to buffer an observation were computed according to the following analyses.
3779	0	a	Since in this case it is assumed that it takes the S/C 50 seconds to slew to the source, the ?uX is already at or below 4000 cps by the time the S/ C has slewed to the target and generated an XRT Position and an XRT image report.
3780	0	a	Within 30 minutes, the maximum length of an observation before the target is occulted, the data rate has dropped to less than 700bps.
3781	0	a	During such an observation the XRT would generate about 2.7MB of data, for an average rate of about 12kbps.
3782	1	a	Table 4 shows the eXpected data that would be generated by the XRT if it could observe the burst described above for 24 continuous hours.
3783	0	a	However, Southwest Research Institute 04121-XCPSRS-01 XRT Control Processor April 23, 2001 Rev.
3784	0	a	Hence, the data rate of the continuous, 24-hour observation of a new burst represents the maximum data rate expected for the XRT.
3785	0	a	Under this scenario, the XRT would generate about 10MB of data per day, for an average rate of about 1kbps, which is well within the 3.9kbps average rate allocated to the XRT for science telemetry.
3786	1	a	Hence, under these conditions, if the amount of memory allocated for observation buffers exceeds 10MB, the XRT should easily be able to meet its allocated science telemetry rate.
3787	1	a	4.2.4.1Software Con?guration Integrity The XCP maintains primary and alternate FSW con?gurations in EEPROM.
3788	1	a	The primary FSW con?guration in EEPROM is software locked to be read-only.
3789	1	a	The primary FSW provides MIL-STD-1553B communications with the SCU provided there are no failures.

3801	1	a	The EDAC can detect and correct single bit errors.
3802	1	a	The EDAC can detect double bit errors.
3803	1	a	Both events cause an interrupt, and the software logs information about the error including the affected address and incrementing the EDAC error count.
3804	0	a	Multiple bit errors (two or more) cause the software to reset the processor by discontinuing strobing of the watchdog timer, which causes the watchdog timer to reset the board when it times out.
3805	1	a	A low priority software task called the Memory Scrubber runs when no other tasks are executing.
3806	0	a	This task steps through DRAM and reads each location.
3807	1	a	When a word is read that contains a single-bit error, this routine rewrites it to correct the problem, and the problem is logged to EEPROM through the interrupt mechanism.
3808	1	a	The scrubbing process seeks to repair single bit errors before they become uncorrectable multiple bit errors.
3809	1	a	Multiple bit errors uncovered by the scrubber result in a reset, even if the memory was not currently in use for processing by the FSW.
3810	1	a	4.2.4.3Error Reporting Errors are reported in XCP housekeeping telemetry.

3814	1	a	Low-level driver integration and testing is accomplished using a XCP-resident test application which exercises the hardware interfaces Via actual ?ight software drivers.
3815	1	a	A Ground Support Equipment (GSE)?resident application communicates with the XCP-resident test application over an RS-232 port which is unused on ?ight.
3816	1	a	The GSE- resident application commands the XCP-resident application to output or receive data on a particular hardware interface.
3817	1	a	The GSE has a direct connection to each hardware interface, and stimulates or measures the interface in accordance with the command sent to the XCP.

4627	0	a	Currently, there are many groups offering many different tools for visualising data.
4628	0	a	These visualisation tools provide a range from tabular to three-dimensional graphical views.
4629	0	a	However, a need has been identified for a tool that can display data in a three dimensional environment, which allows the user to investigate the data and easily see various attributes of the data at a glance.
4630	0	a	A need for the above-mentioned tool has been identified and, there being no applicable tool available, a project to create such a tool was conceptualised.
4631	0	a	The primary stakeholder (see 1.2.1) has made the case that the tool to be created is of relevance use and there is a real need for it.
4632	0	a	This need is established through continual use of other similar tools and a continued identification of their shortfalls.
4633	0	a	1.1.2 Goals of the Product We want to give the user the ability to visualise and investigate their data in a three dimensional environment.
4634	1	a	The user should have the ability to see (at a glance) the differences of various selected attributes of their data.

4665	0	a	1.6 Assumptions This section contains a list of assumptions that are to be made by the developers.
4666	0	a	? The users have the computing skill for basic operation of one of the operating systems documented in 1.4.3.
4667	0	a	See 3.3 for minimum requirements for the work station.
4668	0	a	For a description of any of the below-mentioned names, please refer to 1.5.
4669	0	a	The context diagram above represents the Grid 3D application during the initialisation stages.
4670	0	a	It is important to differentiate this with the work context for the application in a state of running.
4671	0	a	The following diagram aims to describe the work context for the application when it is being run by the users (identified above).
4672	0	a	In the following diagram, the users are grouped as one entity.
4673	0	a	This is for convenience only and should be thought of as separate entities.
4674	0	a	However, the work context applies to each of them in the same manner and, therefore, have been grouped to further the simplicity and understandability of the diagram.
4675	0	a	The purpose of this section is to identify all the business events to which the product responds.
4676	0	a	This is to identify the logical parts of work that can be used as the basis for discovering the detailed requirements.
4677	0	a	This section aims to generate some use cases for the Grid 3D application.
4678	1	a	These shall be generated from the events list contained in 2.1.2.
4679	1	a	It is hoped that use cases can be given that cover all the events listed in 2.1.2.
4680	0	a	With this in mind, the use cases will cover more than one event as more than one event can be captured with a single use-case.
4681	0	a	This section describes the functional requirements for the Grid 3D application.
4682	0	a	Each functional requirement should have a fit criterion in order to make it possible to test whether the requirement is implemented as specified in the delivered product.
4683	1	a	? The product shall plot the data points in a scientifically correct manner.
4684	1	a	? The grid axis should be labelled correctly according to the input from the data file.
4685	1	a	? Data points should be coloured in accordance to the cluster number (contained in the data file) ? The product should be able to handle up to 2000 data points.
4686	1	a	? A single click of the mouse over a data point should bring up the name of the data point.
4687	0	a	? A double-click of the mouse over the data point should cause the application to display all the data point's details.
4688	0	a	? The product should allow multiple points to clicked so that multiple names can be displayed.
4689	0	a	? The product should allow the grid to be oriented by the user.
4690	0	a	Rotation, zoom and move functions should be employed.
4691	0	a	2.2.2 Data Requirements The use of the Grid 3D application involves the user supplying a data file.
4692	1	a	This data file contains all the information of the points that are to be plotted.
4693	1	a	This is the attribute that is to be used as the comparison.
4694	0	a	? A description for the data point.
4695	0	a	In order for the grid to reflect the nature of the user's data, the system should allow for the user to specify their own axis.
4696	0	a	With this in mind, the first row of the data file should contain the column headings.
4697	0	a	The following table proposes the format for the data file.
4698	1	a	? The axis should be clearly labelled and easily recognised after the grid has been oriented into a different position.
4699	1	a	? The application should be coloured so that the screen shots can be printed out clearly (i.e., black on white background).
4700	1	a	? The application should be intuitive and not require any specialist training.
4701	1	a	3.2 Performance Requirements This section aims to specify some of the timing and performance constraints to which the product will aim to adhere.
4702	1	a	? The program should start within 30 seconds ? This depends on the number of data points that are to be plotted.
4703	1	a	? The interaction with the data points should have a delay of no longer than 2 seconds.
4704	1	a	? The response to a change in the orientation should be fast enough to avoid interrupting the user's flow of thought.
4705	0	a	Otherwise known as the Gnome Partition Editor, it is a frontend to the GNU Parted partition editor, and specifically uses its library, libparted, to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables, and perform all the functions it has been designed for.
4706	0	a	Several optional file system tools provide support for file systems not included in libparted.
4707	0	a	This document deals with the functions of the 0.6.0?1 version, made available for public testing in 2010?06?19.
4708	0	a	The software being described in this document has already been developed.
4709	0	a	The functions and characteristics that will be analysed have already been implemented.
4710	0	a	This document has to stay updated with any new features that will be added in future versions of the application.
4711	0	a	Section 4 discusses the external interface requirements, and finally, in section 5, you can find the nonfunctional requirements of the project.
4712	0	a	Each section is divided in subsections where different matters are discussed. 
4713	0	a	1.4 Project Scope GParted is one of many programs used for creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking and copying partitions, and the file systems on them.
4714	0	a	This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing disk space, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).
4715	0	a	With this you can boot your computer and use the application.
4716	0	a	With the .zip file, you can create a bootable USB flash drive, and use that instead of the cd.
4717	1	a	It is one of the best among the many of its kind, supporting more file systems and providing more functions than the rest (Clonezilla, Parted Magic, Parted (backend to GParted), Partition Image, Partition Magic for Windows etc.).
4718	1	a	It is written in C++ and is based on the Debian GNU/Linux operating system.
4719	1	a	It is a frontend to the GNU Parted application which was written by the GNU team and supports creating, destroying, resizing, checking, and copying partitions, and the file systems on them, but only through command line.
4720	1	a	GParted provides the graphical user interface for ease of access.
4721	0	a	Other programs use the Parted libraries as well, like KDE Partition Manager and Pyparted.
4722	0	a	Because this is a Linux?based application it relies on some other software in order for it to work.
4723	0	a	GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables.
4724	0	a	This includes but is not limited to:
4725	0	a	This is important, documentation and help files are vital to any project?s completeness. 2.4 Operating Environment GParted is developed on x86 based computers using GNU/Linux.
4726	1	a	It can be used on other operating systems, such as Windows or Mac OS X, by booting from media containing GParted Live.
4727	0	a	In other words you will need a Linux operating system for the install version of GParted.
4728	0	a	The Live version, on which this document is based, needs a basic x86 ?computer, regardless of the operating system, with a CD drive and/or USB port.
4729	0	a	In general, it does not consume many resources and almost every computer will be able to handle it properly. 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
4730	1	a	The program does not support every kind of operation performed in every kind of file system, but it is constantly being updated and more and more actions and file systems will be supported in the future.
4731	0	a	The table of permitted actions in supported file systems is in section 2.2. GParted does not support logical volume management (LVMэ) at present, although this feature has been requested by many users and may be implemented in a future release.
4732	1	a	It also must be noted that GParted is not to blame, on most occasions, if a specific operation cannot be performed on a specific file system.
4733	1	a	It uses a wide variety of third party libraries and tools which perform these operations.
4734	0	a	GParted is simply a frontend, which brings together all these underlying functions and processes, and presents them in a graphical and accessible way. GParted requires a working Linux environment for it to work.
4735	0	a	The Live version requires a working CD/DVD drive for it to boot the computer.
4736	0	a	As every other Linux application, there is a list of dependencies, or a list of packages required for the program to work.
4737	0	a	In this occasion, they are file system tools.
4738	0	a	After booting your computer with GParted Live, this is the first screen you see. GParted provides some other modes, other than the first default.
4739	1	a	These include loading to RAM only, safe graphic settings, and failsafe mode. You can also boot your computer?s operating system (if any) and run RAM tests using Memtest86+.
4740	0	a	Selecting the first option, advances the application forwards and presents us with the next screen. 3.2 Select Keymap
4741	0	a	The keymap is the layout of symbols on your keyboard. Different keymaps are supported; this screen gives info about them.
4742	0	a	Selecting the keymap you want, brings you to the language selection menu.
4743	0	a	A list of a wide variety of supported languages is displayed.
4744	0	a	You then enter the number that corresponds to the desired language.
4745	0	a	After that, you are presented with a video mode preference menu.
4746	0	a	The default value you type is 0, which loads the GParted Live application.
4747	0	a	On the desktop you can find all the program?s functions.
4748	0	a	Under that, is a bar which contains the most common functions of the program, which you can perform on the drive (hard disk, USB flash etc.) selected from the drop down menu on the far right.
4749	0	a	This can be useful if, for example, you plug in a USB flash drive after GParted has booted.
4750	0	a	Every time you perform an operation, it goes in pending mode.
4751	0	a	Then, you can undo if you regret your choice, or go ahead and click apply for the changes to happen.
4752	0	a	Clear all removes every pending operation from the list.
4753	0	a	You can also undo and apply from the respective buttons on the main functions bar. 
4754	0	a	3.8 View Device Information You can view the selected device?s information by clicking View?>Device Information.
4755	1	a	This brings up information about the selected drive on the left side of the GParted main window. 
4756	1	a	Details like the device?s model, size, heads, sectors, cylinders etc. are shown. 
4757	1	a	A warning is displayed saying that all of your data will be erased.
4758	0	a	3.9 Create Partition Table Clicking on Device?>Create Partition Table lets you create the drive?s partition table?.
4759	0	a	So proceed with caution.
4760	1	a	A wide variety of partition tables are supported and the default one is ms? dos. ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_table 3.10
4761	1	a	Create a New Partition To create a new partition, first select the desired hard disk or other device, from the drop down menu on the right.
4762	0	a	Then you can either click on New from the main functions bar, or go to Partition?>New.
4763	0	a	A pop up dialog window appears on screen.
4764	0	a	Here you have various options.
4765	1	a	First of all, there is a slider which shrinks and moves to either side.
4766	1	a	This represents the size and position of the partition you will create.
4767	1	a	Then, you define the type of the partition (Primary, Logical, Extended) and select the desired file system to format the partition.
4768	1	a	The list is displayed in the last screenshot.
4769	0	a	You can also leave the partition unformatted if you wish to and format it later.
4770	0	a	If you wish to label the partition, GParted lets you do so in this dialog.
4771	0	a	Press Add and then Apply to create the partition.
4772	0	a	In this screenshot we have selected this part of the disk as the partition we will create.
4773	0	a	It is shrunk and sits on the start of the disk.
4774	0	a	In the same way, it can be larger or smaller, and sit in the end, or anywhere else on the disk. 3.11
4775	1	a	Delete a Partition Select the partition you want to delete.
4776	0	a	Then click on Resize/Move from the main functions bar or go to Partition?>Resize/Move.
4777	0	a	A dialog window appears, with the same slider as in the create partition window.
4778	0	a	You use it in the same way or type in the numbers in Megabytes directly.
4779	0	a	In this screenshot, it appears that the partition spans the whole drive; we want to shrink it and free up the disk space after it, which will then become unallocated space.
4780	0	a	Press Resize/Move and then Apply. 3.13 Copy Partition Select the partition you would like to copy.
4781	1	a	This is partition cloning, useful if, for example, you migrate to a larger hard drive and wish to keep your data and operating system (without reformatting). Click on Copy from the main functions bar or go to Partition?>Copy.
4782	0	a	A dialog window opens.
4783	0	a	As with Resize/Move, there is a slider.
4784	1	a	You can leave it at the default setting, which the exact same size of the partition being copied, or you can only slide it up for the pasted partition to take up more (free) space than the copied one.
4785	1	a	You can also move around the pasted partition, it doesn?t have to be at the start of the unallocated space.
4786	1	a	Here you see the slider which defaults at the size of the partition to copy, but you can change that if you want.
4787	1	a	IMPORTANT: You can paste over an existing partition (whether it?s formatted or unformatted).
4788	0	a	A warning is shown that you will lose all of that partition?s data.
4789	0	a	So paste with caution.
4790	0	a	After you have created a partition (regardless of formatting it or not) you can format it to the file system you like.
4791	1	a	First, select the partition you want to format.
4792	1	a	Then, click on Partition?>Format to.
4793	0	a	A list of the supported file systems appears.
4794	0	a	Click on the desired one and then click on Apply. 3.16 Unmount Partition
4795	0	a	If you have mounted a partition to a specific mount point, you can unmount it by clicking on Partition?>Unmount.
4796	1	a	Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Manage Flags, brings up a dialog window with flags and checkboxes. These are functions supported by the partition, like if the partition is bootable, if it is hidden etc.
4797	1	a	Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Check, sends in pending mode the check and repair partition errors operation.
4798	0	a	Click on Apply to have the partition?s file system analyzed, checked for errors and repaired if errors are found. 3.19 Label Partition
4799	1	a	Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Label, opens a dialog window asking to name your partition.
4800	0	a	You could also do that when creating the partition, but if you missed it or didn?t want to do it then, you can label your partition from this option.
4801	0	a	You cannot label every partition, because some file systems don?t support labeling. 3.20
4802	1	a	Take a Screenshot of the Desktop or an Active Window Clicking on Screenshot on the desktop, opens a dialog window which informs you that after clicking Yes, a cross?pointer appears and you select the window you want to print?screen.
4803	0	a	When the cross?hair appears, you can click on any active window to take its screenshot, or click somewhere in the desktop?s wallpaper for a general desktop screenshot.
4804	0	a	A preview of the screenshot is displayed, and a pop?up message informs you that your screenshot has been saved as gparted.jpeg under /root.
4805	0	a	For saving screenshots to a device, please refer to 3.21. 3.21 Terminal & Mount Partitions and Save Screenshots to a Device
4806	0	a	Apart from the main GParted window, you can also launch a command line utility by clicking on Terminal.
4807	0	a	This is useful for more advanced operations, or if some operations cannot be performed in the main GParted window.
4808	0	a	The supported shell is bash.
4809	0	a	For example, you can mount a partition to a mount point in the system.
4810	0	a	This can be done only through Terminal.
4811	0	a	It is also used for copying your saved screenshots from the system?s virtual drive to a hard disk or USB flash drive.
4812	0	a	The first option opens Terminal and presents you with a list of packages and libraries installed in GParted.
4813	0	a	The second option opens resize?windows.txt in Terminal, which shows you some things you should be careful of when resizing Windows XP and Windows Vista partitions.
4814	0	a	You quit by pressing q. 3.23 Screen Resolution Changer Clicking on Screen resolution brings up a window with monitor resolution options.
4815	0	a	Here you can select the resolution that best fits your monitor.
4816	0	a	This is the first screen of the program that the user sees, and the part where most of the operations take place.
4817	0	a	On the top, there is the menu bar with each option (GParted, Edit, View, Device, Partition) corresponding to a set of actions you can perform on a disk.
4818	0	a	Under that, is a bar which contains the most common functions of the program.
4819	0	a	Then the selected drive?s partitions are presented in both graphical and detailed mode. ? Cancel and Apply
4820	0	a	Every time you try to edit in any way, any partition, a confirmation dialog appears which warns about the potential of data loss.
4821	0	a	You can either click Cancel or Apply. ? Pasting into an existing partition You can copy a partition, and then paste it on another existing one, whether it is formatted or not.

5104	0	a	There must be software to support the ?exible scheduling.
5105	1	a	To maximize the use of the available observing time it must be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the currently available instruments.
5106	1	a	These would be in the form of preprogrammed observing sequences.
5107	1	a	It should be possible to resort the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front of the queue.
5108	1	a	This sorting will be based on properties of the individual observing sequences. current site conditions.
5109	1	a	Thus queue scheduling is a superset of preprogrammed observing. with similar I requirements.
5110	1	a	As the costs of implementing such a scheduler are currently dif?cult to estimate it may prove necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project.
5111	0	a	It also covers remote eavesdropping.
5112	0	a	(There will always be support staff on?site during observations. however.)
5113	0	a	The requirements for supporting remote operations are:

5125	0	a	It is only nec? essary that the functionality of the system be transparent.
5126	0	a	it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system.
5127	1	a	However the system design should minimize the impact of link bandwidth on transparency. Security of operation shall be considered and might imply different operation levels and privileges at different sites.
5128	0	a	It is required that the remote operations software be considered from the beginning in the Gemini 8m Telescopes software design.
5129	0	a	This should reduce the amount of speci?c software needed for remote operations.

5473	0	a	This is the Software Requirement Specification for GOG, which describes in detail the objec- tives of the software simulator and the requirements to be considered on its design and con- struction.
5474	0	a	It will use error models to provide rapid simulations of large amount of data.
5475	0	a	The realism of the simulations depends on the realism of the available error models.
5476	0	a	The schema shown in figure 1 depicts from a high level perspective where GOG will produce its data on the overall current data flow for Gaia:
5477	0	a	The implementation of the instrumental error models is planned to be a gradual process that will be based on the study of the detailed pixel-level simulated data produced by GIBIS.
5478	0	a	The simulation of processed data requires models of the calibration errors that will be provided by the CUs in charge of the calibration algorithms development.
5479	0	a	In order to simulate data at a pre- cise step of the processing, the addition of the calibration errors is planned to be user-selectable.
5480	0	a	The output format of GOG simulated data will be according to the Interface Control Document for the Gaia Main database (GAIA-C3-SP-ESAC-JH-002 in preparation).
5481	0	a	Note that some of the steps and options described here will have to be revised when the actual ICD will be available.
5482	0	a	GOG is expected to be in continuous evolution depending on the availability of the error mod- els.
5483	0	a	To allow satisfying all the needs to access specific data, GOG will be entirely modular and configurable through an input configuration file.
5484	0	a	For the source generation, 2 main options will be available:
5485	1	a	1. Generation of the data from the Universe model of the GaiaSimu library: the user will specify a sky region (e.g. an HTM, square, circle).
5486	0	a	Note that the relative positions of the sources with each other will not be used by GOG to add overlapping effects, GOG only works source by source.
5487	0	a	Only the density at the source position could be used to adjust the error models (if they are provided as a function of density).
5488	0	a	The user can ask for only one typical epoch data or for all the transits of the source.
5489	1	a	Two main types of noises will be simulated: 1. Instrumental noise: noise that will come from the observation process, e.g. on-board detection and tracking or observation dead-time. 2. Reduction noise:
5490	0	a	This will depend on the availability of the models.
5491	0	a	Note that GOG aim will not be to produce raw data but pre-processed data
5492	0	a	The following requirements have been capture thinking on a GOG generic operational
5493	0	a	At this stage some spectations for GOG might changed.
5494	1	a	The main hurdle GOG has, is that the contents of the main database are not fully completed. For this reason the initial versions of Gog will consider the current specifications and will be based on the restrictions described in section 11.
5495	0	a	On this overview we see GOG as a unique software product.
5496	0	a	From the high level perspective it can be decomposed on the SADT diagram as follows:
5497	0	a	FIGURE 2: GOG general i/o context diagram Exploding the central box, looking one level deeper, we could distinguish the following main blocks of execution.
5498	0	a	The following pictures shows how the problem is depicted. 2.2 Decomposition
5499	0	a	According to TL-001 a ?Software Product? is composed of several ?Modules?.
5500	0	a	In this section we describe how the system is logically decomposed and mention the modules which will appear from Sect. 3 onward and how they interact. GOG as a software product can be decomposed in software modules.
5501	0	a	We have identified the following main conceptual modules
5502	0	a	This is for high level requirements which apply to all modules.
5503	0	a	These requirements may be removed from this document and appear in a higher level requirements document for CU2or at the DPC level.
5504	0	a	That is, it will use as other the other simulators the Gaia Simu library and the Gaia Tools library.
5505	1	a	For source generation GOG has 2 main options available: Universe Model from GaiaSimu or a Object Input Catalogue GOG has a source by source processing mechanism GOG must consider noise effects.
5506	1	a	For noise generation those effects should be user- selectable (they can be added or not and the values should be given by users).We classify noises in two groups:

6404	0	a	eProcurement is a many-to-many electronic data interchange (EDI) problem on a large scale and requires both the sender and the receiver to interpret each and every data element in precisely the same way.
6405	0	a	In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.
6406	0	a	Such an incremental approach demands that all Documents (those adopted earlier and later) represent the same things in a common way.

6408	0	a	1.2 Benefits These requirements support several Government initiatives, including: .
6409	0	a	The greatest benefits accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re- keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.

6744	1	a	Level 3, the highest level administrative user has all access, update, add, delete permissions, and can create other administrative users at any level.
6745	1	a	Level 2, has update, add permissions, and can create administrative users up to Level 2.
6746	1	a	Level 1, has add permissions and can add administrative users at Level 1 only.
6747	0	a	2.4 Operating Environment The proposed ColorKast Solution will be implemented in a client/server model.
6748	1	a	All processing of searches and storing of information will be local to the server.
6749	0	a	Client: The web-based client is compatible with most operating systems and requires a working installation of Internet Explorer 4.01, Netscape 6.0, or Mozilla 1.0 or later.
6750	0	a	The client computer should match or exceed the system requirements specified for the web browser intended for use with the client application.
6751	0	a	2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints A few issues limit our choices when implementing a suitable solution for the ABC Paint Project.
6752	0	a	It is very important that the application be web-based.
6753	1	a	We understand that in any design choice, precedence should be given to the implementation of a completely web-based client.
6754	1	a	Wherever possible, the application should retain full usability with a keyboard input device only.
6755	0	a	This allows an easy transition for employees who are primarily used to keyboard input in current ABC Paint business applications.
6756	0	a	Finally, a utility should be available to report errors.
6757	0	a	In all instances, the application should attempt full recovery and report errors automatically to ColorKast without encroaching on the user experience.
6758	0	a	2.6 User Documentation Documentation for users will be made available in the form of on-line help within the client application itself.

6882	0	a	The requirements presented in this document represent the high-level and detailed objectives, constraints, and desires for the Clarus system.
6883	1	a	Each requirement is identified by a unique Clarus-specific identifier to allow the requirement to be referenced in future documents, providing traceability throughout the development process.
6884	0	a	Each detailed requirement is traced to its parent through its identification number followed by a unique identifier.
6885	0	a	A requirements document states what must be accomplished to fulfill the vision described in a concept of operations.
6886	0	a	It does not state how it is to be accomplished.
6887	0	a	This document describes each requirement and the basis for inclusion of that requirement.
6888	0	a	The remaining sections of the document contain the requirements for the system.
6889	0	a	The sections and their content are as follows: Section 2 ? General Description provides a general overview of the entire system.
6890	0	a	This section describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.
6891	0	a	Section 3 ? System Architecture provides an overview of the Clarus system?s components and their functions.

6893	0	a	Section 4 ? Specific Requirements contains the requirements developed from reference documentation and stakeholder communications.
6894	1	a	This section organizes the requirements into categories that facilitate the system development process.
6895	0	a	2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.
6896	0	a	This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context.
6897	0	a	That context and the overall intent of the Clarus program are described in detail in the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref.
6898	0	a	While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks.
6899	0	a	Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.
6900	0	a	Each participating weather network?s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality.
6901	0	a	Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus.
6902	0	a	The primary recipients of this data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able to receive data if they so chose.
6903	0	a	The data will be collected from the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be added.
6904	0	a	When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus.
6905	0	a	Figure 2 shows the general process as data progresses from collection through publication to service providers.
6906	1	a	MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a standard interchange format.
6907	0	a	While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.
6908	0	a	While the participants may want to access the network through ?a one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations? (Ref.
6909	0	a	12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system.
6910	1	a	Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a ?one-stop? portal.
6911	1	a	The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed.
6912	0	a	This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus.
6913	0	a	Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.
6914	0	a	These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions.
6915	0	a	The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between themэ.
6916	0	a	For example, a ?Collector? administers a ?Sensor,? collects ?Observation Data,? provides ?Sensor Metadata,? and receives ?Quality Feedback?.
6917	0	a	The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.
6918	0	a	Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.
6919	0	a	These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref.
6920	0	a	8) and summarized in Table 1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.
6921	0	a	The design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the technical limitations of the system architecture.
6922	1	a	Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and machine-based product generation.
6923	0	a	The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers.
6924	0	a	The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.
6925	0	a	2.3 User Characteristics Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience.
6926	1	a	Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.
6927	1	a	The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.
6928	0	a	This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative.
6929	0	a	The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system.
6930	0	a	From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref.
6931	0	a	7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user?s interface or interaction with Clarus data.
6932	1	a	The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.
6933	1	a	The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.
6934	1	a	The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data.
6935	1	a	The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community.
6936	0	a	The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data.
6937	0	a	Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups.
6938	0	a	The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus.
6939	0	a	The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system.
6940	0	a	The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems.
6941	0	a	These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer ? the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system.
6942	0	a	These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system.
6943	0	a	The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.
6944	0	a	Figure 6 ? Context Diagram of Clarus User Needs The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.
6945	1	a	These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community.
6946	0	a	This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions.
6947	0	a	These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers.
6948	0	a	Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.
6949	0	a	? Transit ? These are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality- controlled data from it.
6950	0	a	This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.
6951	0	a	? Rail ? These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.
6952	0	a	As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.
6953	0	a	? Archives ? This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors.
6954	0	a	The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.
6955	0	a	2.4 General Constraints Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.
6956	1	a	Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.
6957	1	a	To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates.
6958	1	a	An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue.
6959	0	a	The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the system to expand and add new data sources and end-users.
6960	0	a	Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system.
6961	0	a	To maximize system uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of the system.
6962	0	a	While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.
6963	0	a	If the Clarus system fails, requestors will need to use their legacy systems.
6964	0	a	The system will be ?open,? using architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry.
6965	0	a	The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable.
6966	0	a	Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards.
6967	0	a	? Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No.
6968	0	a	A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to ?critical national security missions.? Future applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.
6969	0	a	2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers.
6970	1	a	While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources.
6971	0	a	Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system.
6972	0	a	Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data.
6973	0	a	Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers.
6974	1	a	Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.
6975	0	a	Several requirements deal with ?regional? needs, without specifying regional boundaries.
6976	0	a	It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems.
6977	0	a	It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different (though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks.
6978	1	a	Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries.
6979	1	a	Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations.
6980	1	a	The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.
6981	1	a	Data in the system database and in published data sets will likely include geo- reference coordinates in decimal longitude, latitude, and elevation.
6982	1	a	Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
6983	1	a	The base assumption regarding ?database tools? is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools.
6984	0	a	No special database tools will be developed as a part of the Clarus system.
6985	0	a	Some tools may developed in the future as part of ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.
6986	0	a	The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this section.
6987	0	a	Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and flow of information within the Clarus system.
6988	0	a	A set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information.
6989	0	a	The particular collector, QED, or EM service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the environmental data.
6990	0	a	The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service.
6991	0	a	It is a set of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus.
6992	0	a	The specific algorithms and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules established through the configuration & administration service.
6993	0	a	This arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.
6994	0	a	There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and schedule services.
6995	0	a	The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service disruption.
6996	1	a	The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors.
6997	1	a	The schedule service will also prioritize and respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure 7).
6998	0	a	The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods.
6999	0	a	Flagging out-of-range values is one example of a quality rule.
7000	0	a	Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data.
7001	0	a	This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process.
7002	1	a	The QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality and can be continuously delivered.
7003	1	a	The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users.
7004	0	a	Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers.
7005	0	a	Each of these components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a particular data format.
7006	0	a	The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and program.
7007	1	a	It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED retrieval schedules.
7008	0	a	The configuration & administration service manages environ- mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage.
7009	1	a	Data transactions and system operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user interface as well.
7010	0	a	The configuration and administration user interface allows administrative users to interact with these functions and supports the manual quality review processes.
7011	0	a	These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to specific components within the Clarus system.
7012	1	a	The types of high-level requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces.
7013	0	a	Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, development, and packaging of environmental data.
7014	0	a	Figure 8 ? High-Level Requirements Context The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities.
7015	0	a	The high-level requirements provide a basis for components in system elaboration, and detailed requirements are subsequently tied to specific components.
7016	0	a	Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements.
7017	0	a	The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high- level requirements.
7018	0	a	In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3.
7019	1	a	? Functional Requirements ? Lists the characteristics that the system must support for each interface.

7022	1	a	? Organizational Requirements ? Includes requirements for policies and procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and institutional requirements to support the system.
7023	0	a	Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the purpose or content of each column of the requirements table.
7024	1	a	The matrix includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which have been deferred due to cost or complexity.
7025	0	a	Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering system.
7026	1	a	The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the classification and NNN is a unique number.
7027	1	a	The detailed requirements are identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement and UU is a unique identifier.
7028	0	a	This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support.
7029	0	a	It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.
7030	0	a	The functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific modules listed in Table 4.
7031	0	a	Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement.
7032	1	a	Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or component of the Clarus system.
7033	1	a	Within each table, the high-level requirements show their allocations to particular modules.
7034	0	a	If the high-level requirement is allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be repeated in the corresponding allocation?s module.
7035	0	a	These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept of Operations (ConOps), in meetings with potential users and participants, and in subsequent documents identified below.
7036	0	a	These requirements will form the basis for the design verification and validation of the system.

7085	0	a	12), from which much of the description in this section was derived.
7086	0	a	2.1 System Perspective The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a ?network of networks? ? much like the Internet ? for surface transportation environmental data.
7087	1	a	While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks.
7088	1	a	Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.
7089	1	a	Each participating weather network?s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality.
7090	1	a	First, the participants will be able to share collected environmental data with Clarus.
7091	1	a	Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus.
7092	0	a	When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus.
7093	1	a	MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a standard interchange format.
7094	0	a	While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.
7095	0	a	While the participants may want to access the network through ?a one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations? (Ref.
7096	0	a	12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system.
7097	0	a	Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a ?one-stop? portal.
7098	0	a	The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed.
7099	0	a	This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus.
7100	0	a	Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.
7101	0	a	These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions.
7102	0	a	The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between themэ.
7103	0	a	For example, a ?Collector? administers a ?Sensor,? collects ?Observation Data,? provides ?Sensor Metadata,? and receives ?Quality Feedback?.
7104	0	a	The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.
7105	0	a	Determining data types will be a significant challenge.
7106	0	a	Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.
7107	0	a	These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref.
7108	0	a	8) and summarized in Table 1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.
7109	0	a	There is also a period for which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements.
7110	0	a	Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and machine-based product generation.
7111	0	a	The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers.
7112	0	a	The Clarus system design must address how best to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner.
7113	0	a	The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.
7114	0	a	? Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as it is transferred from the ESS to the end user.
7115	0	a	Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.
7116	0	a	The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.
7117	0	a	This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative.
7118	0	a	The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system.
7119	0	a	From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref.
7120	1	a	5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation (WIST) (Ref.
7121	1	a	6), and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref.
7122	1	a	7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user?s interface or interaction with Clarus data.
7123	1	a	The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.
7124	0	a	The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.
7125	0	a	The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data.
7126	0	a	The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community.
7127	0	a	The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data.
7128	0	a	Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups.
7129	1	a	There is an inherent time scale, similar to Figure 4, emanating from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of data through the Clarus system and between the layers.
7130	0	a	The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus.
7131	0	a	The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system.
7132	0	a	The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems.
7133	0	a	These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer ? the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system.
7134	0	a	These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system.
7135	0	a	The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.
7136	0	a	Figure 6 ? Context Diagram of Clarus User Needs The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.
7137	0	a	These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community.
7138	0	a	This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions.
7139	0	a	These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers.
7140	1	a	Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.
7141	0	a	This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.
7142	1	a	? Rail ? These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.
7143	0	a	As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.
7144	1	a	? Weather Service Providers ? These include the weather support services that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic components of the Clarus data.
7145	1	a	? Archives ? This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors.
7146	0	a	The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.
7147	0	a	2.4 General Constraints Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.
7148	0	a	Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.
7149	0	a	To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates.
7150	0	a	An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue.
7151	0	a	Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment considerations.
7152	0	a	Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system.
7153	0	a	While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.
7154	0	a	If the Clarus system fails, requestors will need to use their legacy systems.
7155	1	a	The system will be ?open,? using architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry.
7156	1	a	The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable.
7157	0	a	Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards.
7158	1	a	? Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No.
7159	0	a	A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to ?critical national security missions.? Future applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.
7160	0	a	2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers.
7161	0	a	While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources.
7162	0	a	Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system.
7163	0	a	Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data.
7164	0	a	Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers.
7165	0	a	Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.
7166	0	a	Accepting data from contributors who cannot provide these tags with the data could seriously complicate the design of the data acquisition interfaces.
7167	0	a	Several requirements deal with ?regional? needs, without specifying regional boundaries.
7168	1	a	It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems.
7169	1	a	It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different (though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks.
7170	1	a	Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries.
7171	0	a	Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations.
7172	0	a	The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.
7173	0	a	Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
7174	1	a	The base assumption regarding ?database tools? is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools.
7175	0	a	Some tools may developed in the future as part of ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.
7176	0	a	The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this section.
7177	0	a	Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and flow of information within the Clarus system.
7178	0	a	The collector, QED, and EM services are sets of services because each individual service represents a particular data format interface.
7179	0	a	A set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information.
7180	0	a	The particular collector, QED, or EM service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the environmental data.
7181	0	a	The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service.
7182	0	a	It is a set of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus.
7183	0	a	The specific algorithms and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules established through the configuration & administration service.
7184	0	a	This arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.
7185	0	a	There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and schedule services.
7186	0	a	The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service disruption.
7187	1	a	The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors.
7188	1	a	The schedule service will also prioritize and respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure 7).
7189	1	a	The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods.
7190	0	a	Flagging out-of-range values is one example of a quality rule.
7191	0	a	Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data.
7192	0	a	This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process.
7193	1	a	The QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality and can be continuously delivered.
7194	1	a	The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users.
7195	0	a	Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers.
7196	0	a	Each of these components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a particular data format.
7197	0	a	The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and program.
7198	0	a	It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED retrieval schedules.
7199	0	a	The configuration & administration service manages environ- mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage.
7200	0	a	Data transactions and system operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user interface as well.
7201	0	a	These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to specific components within the Clarus system.
7202	0	a	The high-level requirements in this document are limited to those that can be derived from a context diagram (Figure 8) that pictures the Clarus system as a single functional block with its interfaces.
7203	0	a	The types of high-level requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces.
7204	0	a	Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, development, and packaging of environmental data.
7205	0	a	Figure 8 ? High-Level Requirements Context The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities.
7206	0	a	Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements.
7207	0	a	The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high- level requirements.
7208	0	a	In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3.

7218	0	a	It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.
7219	0	a	The functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific modules listed in Table 4.
7220	0	a	Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement.
7221	0	a	Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or component of the Clarus system.
7222	0	a	Within each table, the high-level requirements show their allocations to particular modules.
7223	0	a	If the high-level requirement is allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be repeated in the corresponding allocation?s module.
