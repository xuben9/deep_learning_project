Project Scope The project being developed for NJIT goes by the name of VIRTUAL-EDU.
"The document will satisfy our project scope by delivering well documented specifications, along with highly detailed models."
"Furthermore, it will contain comprehensive explanations of the functionality and constraints of each of the following requirements."
Product Perspective Virtual-EDU consists of an online website that allows users to create a classroom like environment with the features that it contains.
"Once registered to the system, a user can create a profile sharing his or her information with the rest of the enrolled users."
Users will be able to find commonalities with each other through the user profile.
Virtual-EDU also gives users the ability to store data and/or important materials in a secure network location for future retrieval or present usage.
This particular data as well as other files may be shared or worked on using Virtual-EDU extensive tools for file sharing and document collaboration.
Users can work together on a single document in real time or send their work to other users via secure file sharing methods and protocols.
"If further communication is need between users, Virtual-EDU has features such as instant messaging, where users can hold single or group conversations via a secure real-time communication based on typed text."
"However, if more efficient means of communication are need, users have the ability to hold single or group video/audio conferences, whereby the users will be able to see other users streamed live in real-time."
The top level diagram below shows all of the user features that will be implemented for the system.
"Product Features ? Streaming audio and video (both live and on-demand) will allow users to interact with faculty and fellow classmates over a streaming video and audio, one-to-one or one-to-many connection."
