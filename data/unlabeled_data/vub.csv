Software Requirements Specification
The purpose of this document is to present an overall description and listing of the func- tionality of a Publications Management System (PMS).
"This document is intended for the customer(s) and suppliers of the system including designers, testers and the implementation unit. 1.2 Scope"
"The product will support the functionality of a PMS, which can be accessed by command line and through a web browser (following the W3C XHTML-standards [3])."
The PMS will manage a database with bibliographical information and have the possibility to save the entire text of a publication in pdf and postscript.
Dirk Vermeir? refer to the same author.
"The person, or persons, who pay for the product and usually (but not necessarily) decide the requirements."
In the context of this recommended practice the customer and the supplier may be members of the same organization.
"The person, or persons, who produce a product for a customer."
"In the context of this recommended practice, the customer and the supplier may be members of the same organization."
"The person, or persons, who operate or interact directly with the product."
The user(s) and the customer(s) are often not the same person(s).
This is a tool for formatting lists of references.
The BibTEXtool is typically used together with the LATEXdocument preparation system. Bulk Update: refers in this case to importing many publications(or abstracts) at once (e.g. through BibTeX files).
The RIS file format is a tagged format for expressing bibliographic citations.
"This is a reflective, dynamic, object-oriented programming language."

This is a multifunctional linux server for the students of the faculty of sciences at the VUB. 1.4 Overview
The remaining part of this document is divided into two sections.
In section 2 we will describe the general factors that influence the product and its require- ments.
This section does not state specific requirements.
There will be multiple types of users:
A Guest is an anonymous user that is not connected to the VUB-network.
The PMS will recognize them by their IP-address.
"They can access the database, search for publications and download them."
A Member is a user that has logged into the PMS and whose account only allows him to search for publications and download them. ?
"A Publisher is a logged in user that can search for, upload and download publications."
"A Moderator has the same prerequisites and available functions as a Member, extended with the authority to edit and delete publications."
"This requires that the user provides their first and last name, a password and a valid e-mail address. If a user is accepted, he/she will receive a validation mail and by that way he/she will be able to confirm the registration of the user account."
"Any user will be able to search for publications by title, author(s), institute,. . ."
Also will the user be able to specify that ?
"Users can access the PMS (taking into account their privileges) from any OS, using a web browser that has a connection to the web server running the PMS."
The PMS should explicitly be accessible for users with Linux as OS and using a text based web browser(eg.
Links2 ). Administrator(s) can acces the system by command line from within the VUB-network. ?
There are no specific hardware requirements for the users.
"If an error would occur during a request, the user should receive an error message stating what was the cause of the error."
The error should also be logged in the PMS to notify the Administrator(s) of the occurred technical difficulties. The PMS web interface will comply with the W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard [3].
The other necessary/available operations (functionalities) are discussed in section 2.3 2.2.6 Site adaptation requirements
"The PMS will be easy to install, with Ruby 1.8 (or later) installed and will run under a Linux-based environment. 2.3 Product functions"

"Afterwards, in the second iteration, more functions will be added to the PMS and the previous ones will be enhanced."
"Interface is designed to be fast and efficient, with the aim to be able to do fulfill all available tasks (upload, download, search,. . . ) in the smallest amount of pages and clicks."
"Although the esthetic part is less important, the clarity and structure of the web interface will be very important. 3.1.2 Command Line Interface"

Logical database requirements
"The database must be capable to handle serveral requests at once, these requests happen by using SQL-statements."
For more information about the reliability of the PMS and the therefore used testing processes see the SQAP [12] and STD [13] of SE1. 3.6.2 Availability
"The PMS will be available at all times from any computer ( fulfilling assumptions and dependencies in Section 2.6 ), except when Wilma is not available."
In case of another failure (hardware or software related) the problem should be first solved and afterwards the PMS should be reinitialized.
"During this downtime the PMS should give an error to the visitors , stating that the PMS is temporarily down. 3.6.3 Security Every user account is protected with a personal password."
Nobody except the specific user should be able to log into that account and change personal information.
The password of the user should be encrypted when submitted from user to server.
It should also be saved in an encrypted way in the database and no-one except the PMS should be able to access these passwords.
Direct access to the data stored in the database is only allowed for
"The database of the PMS should be maintained by the Administrator(s). The PMS (with concern to the user levels, special privileges,. . . ) should be maintained by the Administrators on a global level. ?"
"On the Departmental level the Moderator(s) will be able to maintain the PMS this way. If the PMS remains available under all circumstances, there are no other maintenance measures to keep in regard. 3.6.5 Portability"
"The PMS is developped and tested to be able to run on Wilma, as specified by the customer."
"Although this is a linux-based platform, it would be possible to relocate the PMS to a server with a different OS as long as all necessary software is available on it and some adjustments are made."
"Because of the fact that this was not demanded by the customer, we did not fully implement this feature in the PMS. Chapter 4 References"
