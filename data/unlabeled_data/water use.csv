The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a collection and organization of all the requirements surrounding a project.
"The SRS is a collection, or package, of artifacts that describe the complete external behavior of the system (i.e., what the system has to do to deliver those features)."
"Following the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and its iterative nature, the SRS is not a frozen document, but rather a living artifact."
It has a number of uses as the developer begins the implementation efforts.
"It selves as a basis for communication between all parties (i.e., between the developers themselves, between the developers and the stakeholders)."
The SRS will also serve as input to software testing and quality assurance checks.
"During testing, Test Cases will be created to ensure that the developed system does indeed fulfill the requirements outlined in the SRS."
"1.2 Overview The Water Use Tracking (WUT) System?s SRS, as outlined above, is a collection of artifacts that have been developed separately duiing the Implementation Phase of the project."
"This document will also describe how the requirement statements gathered from the stakeholders make their way into use case documents and, eventually, into features of the system."
"Although this system is being built to support the efforts within the SWUCA, it will support the same functionality for anywhere within the District."
"Currently, tracking of spatial and temporal trends in permitted and actual water uses is done using manual and sen1i-automated methodologies by a number of groups in the District."
"This approach is staff time intensive, and since data sources and methodologies vary between different groups conducting these analyses, it may lead to inconsistent or apparently con?icting results."
This is further complicated by the fact that current database management systems and data collection activities were not speci?cally designed to support these types of activities.
The result is that the current system does not adequately support the types of analyses required for successful implementation of the SWUCA Management Plan.
2.2 Product Position Statement The WUT Project will provide software for several different customer types.
"It will also provide tools that can be used to aggregate permitted and actual purnpage over speci?ed geographic areas (model grid cells, counties, Most Impacted Area (MIA), watershed, etc.)."
Resource Conservation and Development Department ? The system will provide information that can be used to assist in the calibration of ground water models.
The system will also provide information on WUPs that can support the establishment and monitoring of Minimum Flows and Levels.
Executive Sta?/Goveming Board ? The system will provide standard reports that are published as hardcopy or web-accessible documents.
"Web accessible maps and documents could be interactive, allow users to zoom, pan, and query areas of interest."
"External Customers ? External customers potentially include local governments, the media, and the general public."
"Standard interactive map interfaces will provide information in a consistent, low maintenance environment."
Other Users ? This system is in line with the objectives of the CWM Information Technology initiative presented to the Governing Board in June 2002.
It will provide improved access to WUP data for all District staff.

1 IBM DB2 Data Server The IBM DB2 data server was upgraded in January 2003 and it is anticipated that it has sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.
It is likewise anticipated that the current DB2 database software configuration will support the proposed system.
2.4.1.2 HP-UXArcSDE/Oracle Data Server The District is currently retiring the obsolete HP Tru-64 computer system and replacing it with an HP-UX system.
It is anticipated that when this upgrade is completed in fiscal year (FY) 2004 that the system will have sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.
"It is likewise anticipated that when the upgrade is completed, current ArcSDE/Oracle database system configuration will support the proposed system."
2.4.1.3 Communications/Data Network The primary impact of this system on the network will occur during the transfer of data between the IBM and HP-UX systems.
"Since this transfer will occur only during non-business hours, it is not anticipated that it will have a significant impact on the current network."
"In the event that these servers are not adequate, they are relatively inexpensive to upgrade."
5 Desktop Workstations It is anticipated that this system will operate within the ArcGIS ArcView and ArcIMS web browser environment that is currently implemented at the District.
"2.5 Product Perspective The system will require a combination of permitting, geographic, and water resource data derived from the following sources."
2.5.1 WUPData The data source for WUPs is the Regulatory Database (RDB).
This database is implemented in the IBM DB2 environment on the District's IBM mainframe data server located in the Tampa Data Center.
The Records and Data Department is the primary entity responsible for the entry and maintenance of the data in the RDB.
"The Information Resources Department (1RD) is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the RDB."
"Water Use Tracking Proj ect ? February 13, 2007 Software Requirements Specification 2."
5.2 Geograph ic Data The data source for geographic data is the GIS.
This database is implemented in the ArcSDE/Oracle environment on the District's HP-UX data server located in the Brooksville computer room.
The Mapping and GIS Section (MGIS) is the primary entity responsible for the entry and maintenance of most of the data in the GIS.
"The Land Resources, Operations, and Records and Data Departments maintain specialized datasets within the GIS."
"IRD and MGIS are jointly responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the GIS."
The source for these data is the Water Management Database (WMDB).
This database is implemented in the IBM DB2 environment on the District's IBM mainframe data server located in the Tampa Data Center.
The Operations Department is the primary entity responsible for the entry and maintenance of the water levels/?ows and meteorological data in the RDB.
"Water quality data stored in the WMDB are collected by multiple departments, processed by the District's laboratory, and loaded into the WMDB."
"It is important to note that while almost all water level information collected by the District is entered into the WMDB, loading of water quality data is less common."
"The WMDB, therefore, does not provide a comprehensive collection of water quality data."
"The Information Resources Department (IRD) is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the WMDB."
"5.4 GIS/RDB/WZWDB Data Integration The proposed system will require the integration of data in the GIS, RDB, and WMDB."
Data in these systems are logically linked using a common identifier known as the Universal ID (U 1D).
Each WUP withdrawal point and data collection site is assigned a UID.
"UIDs are unique for physical objects such as wells, rain gauges, and stream gauges."
Unique UIDs are also assigned to surface water quality sample sites.
"In cases where a well is both associated with a WUP and also serves as a data collection site, it is assigned a single UID that provides linkages to data stored in both the RDB and WMDB."
"In the GIS, the UID is associated with a physical location and, therefore, can be represented within a data layer representing WUPs, stream gauges, or rainfall stations."
Data are physically transferred from the DB2-based WMDB and RDB to the ArcSDE/Oracle based GIS using the Transformation Server software.
This software provides tools for moving data between databases in their entirety or as selected subsets.
"While this transfer is currently only done from the WMDB/RDB to the GIS, it is technically possible to transfer data in the other direction."
"It is assumed that the needed changes, to collect and store the data, will be made within the current application and database."
"However, if the required changes cannot be completed to the current systems in a timely manner, the WUT System will need to implement these requirements within the new application."
It is also assumed that the current databases mentioned above are still available in their current form during the development of the WUT System.
"The WUT System will be dependent on the data stored in the WUP, WMDB, GIS, and RDB databases."
Changes to the current systems would need to be done in collaboration with the WUT Project Development Team.
Communication between the responsible parties is key in the success of the development of this system.
One requirement for the WUT System is that it will be developed with the hardware and software architecture currently in place at the District.
Changes to the current architecture requirements could have a negative impact on the development of this system and cause delays in the release of the system.
2.7 Needs The following is a list of needs that were captured in the SWUCA Permitted Water Use T racking Application 4 Feasibility Study.
"As used here, lapsed quantities refer to any reductions in permitted pumpage for a particular well."
Use cases are a very important artifact of the initial phase of the project.
"The stakeholders for the project are categorized into four categories: Executive Staff, Technical Staff, Science Business Staff, and Regulatory Staff."
Workshops were held for each of these groups with follow-up one-on-one interviews to clarify or refine requirements.
The agenda for each of these workshops was tailored to each of these groups.
"For example, the Executive Staff meeting is more focused on the Vision of the project."
The Technical Staff meeting is more focused on the technical requirements of the project.
"The remaining two groups, mostly made up of the power?users of the system, concentrated on the actual requirements of the system."
An additional workshop was held to outline specific requirements needed for the system to support the SWUCA Recovery Plan.
A summary was produced for each of the workshops and distributed to the participants for reView.
Feedback was received through the reView process and the summaries were updated to re?ect these comments.
3.2 Requirements Traceability Matrix All the requirements gathered during the requirement workshops were reViewed and consolidated into the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).
The purpose of the WUT RTM is to document and manage the business and functional requirements for the WUT Project.
"The WUT RTM provides a master list of business and functional requirements organized into a number of meaningful features, each of which is a set of logically related requirements."
"Within the matrix, each requirement is mapped to one or more use cases within the WUT Use Case Model that supports the requirement."
"Once all requirements are mapped to a use case, SWFWMD is guaranteed that all business and functional requirements will be supported by the WUT software system."
"For purposes of requirements management and traceability, the requestor(s) of each requirement is included in the matrix."
This allows the project development team to easily know whom to contact if questions or concerns arise during the development of the system regarding a certain requirement.
Keeping the WUT RTM updated is a critical success factor because it provides one of the primary mechanisms for measuring and ensuring the success of the WUT Project.
"3.3 Use Case Model and Use Cases The use case model primarily sets the functional requirements on the system, and is used as an essential input to analysis and architectural design."
"In essence, the use case model and use cases are a contract between the proj ect development team and the stakeholders with regards to the functionality of the system."
The initial release of the model in the inception phase is used to outline the scope of the system.
The use case model is refined by more detailed ?ows of events during the elaboration and construction phases.
The use case model is continuously kept consistent with the design model.
The use case model consists of use case packages.
"A use case package is a collection of use cases, actors, relationships, diagrams, and other packages."
It is used to structure the model by dividing it into smaller parts.
The WUT Use Case Model consists of two packages: .
Maintain Water Use Tracking Information .
"View Water Use Permit Information The functionality of a system is defined by use cases, each of which represents a specific ?ow of events."
The description of a use case defines what happens in the system when the use case is performed.
All functional requirements must be able to be linked to at least one use case.
This ensures all required functionality is being included in the system to be built.
Use cases contain several key items: 0 Business Context ? A description of the business need of the use case.
0 Flow of Events ? The sequence of events that can take place during the execution of the use case.
"This includes the Primary Flow, or basic path, Alternate Flows, Warning Flows, and Exception Flows."
"o Post?Conditions ? A list of conditions that can be expected after the use cases ends, dependent on the ?ow of events executed."
0 Special Requirements ? A list of any special requirements for a particular use case.
This is a ?catch-all? section where any information regarding a use case can be captured and stored.
The users and any other system that may interact with the system are the actors.
Use cases are developed on the basis of the actors' needs.
This ensures that the system will turn out to be what the users expected.
Also included in the use case model are the use case diagrams.
These diagrams illustrate the use cases and the actors and the interaction between the two.
Use case diagrams can also be organized by use case packages to show only what is relevant within a particular package.
The WUT Use Case Model was created and is currently stored in the Enterprise Architect modeling tool.
The model also has all use cases that will be developed for the WUT System.
All requirements are linked within the model to one or more use cases.
All the actors identi?ed for the project are also in the model.
The use case diagrams show the interaction between the actors and the use cases.
"In general, there are two types of non-functional requirements, qualitative and general systems."
No specific general systems requirements were gathered during the requirement workshops for the W UT Project.
"Rather, non-functional requirements are documented and managed through a separate deliverable called a Supplementary Specification."
These requirements were collected during the Requirement Workshops held during the Inception Phase of the project.
This Supplementary Specification will be managed and iteratively refined as appropriate throughout the life of the WUT Project.
The Supplementary Specification will be a valuable aid to all members of the WUT Project Development Team.
This specification will be used as a communication medium between the development team and the Project Stakeholders with regards to both qualitative and general systems requirements.
"Finally, the supplementary specification will be used to verify compliance of the non-functional requirements during the testing of the WUT software."
"Within each section, the requirements are organized into a number of features, each of which is a logically related set of requirements."
