1.3 Project Scope This Video Searching software will be a system that uses an active internet connection to search multiple websites for streaming videos or torrents.
The system will be used to aid the user when trying to locate a speci?c video or genre of video.
It will help them reduce searching time through various different websites by searching all these websites with just one query.
It provides tools to help when navigating through search results which will save time and effort.
The software aims to help the user by providing a simple interface and a more ef?cient way of ?nding the video they require.
It will also provide the user with So?ware Requirements Specification for x-my Page 2 various options and tools to help make their search more relevant to the content that they need.
The system will contain databases of the different websites that will be used within the search.
These databases can be easily updated to provide a wider searching range.
"All studies based on private homes of the authors? choosing, all studies created on Feb 2009."
The program is a new self?contained product.
It has come about due to the demand for such a product being identi?ed in a series of Ethnography studies.
From these studies we saw that the main activity people used video for was the watch content found online.
"These people would regularly spend periods of time searching websites to try and ?nd the videos they wanted to watch, either somewhere to stream the video from or the ?les to download the video."
"This was especially true of the studies by Alan Woosnam, lrshad Qabool and Will Josephy."
Our system will aim to speed up this process.
2.2 Product Features The main feature ofthe system will be a search engine for ?nding the location of torrents and streaming sites for videos on the internet.
The user can specify which of the 2 or both to look for.
"The results will be divided into the types that were speci?ed using different tabs, and then the results will be orderable by different categories, such as name, size, site, etc."
"The user will have the option to ?lter out videos containing certain content depending on age restrictions, for example adult content."
In addition the user will have the option to ?lter out or only search certain websites; for example a user may only want to look at videos on YouTube.
"They will have the facility for users to store their favorite videos, so that they can come back to the video at another time."
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics There will be two levels of user for our system.
The ?rst will be the general user that will be using our software to ?nd their videos.
They will only see the front end of the system.
The second level will be the system developers.
"2.4 Operating Environment The system will be portable; this means it will work across different operating systems including Microsoft XP and Vista, Mac OS X and a range of Linux platforms."
"Also it will work with different web browsers, for example Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari."
The hardware needed for our system will be a reasonably up-to-date computer that is connected to the internet via a modem.
The user will give a search-term that will search through a database of compatible torrent websites that are added by the development team.
The results of this search will be displayed as web links in a tab on the program?s main window.
This is one of the main features of the software and therefore has a high priority for development.
Stimulus/Response Sequences User ticks torrent tick box ? system will now query the torrent websites in its database when a search is started.
User enters search term and starts search ? system sends queries to the torrent websites in its database based on the search term.
"Results for this query will then be sent to the torrent tab in the program where they will display information such as website, seeds, peers, size, date posted and a link for the webpage."
User sorts the search results by clicking once on a column header ? system sorts all results by descending/ascending order.
User clicks on next page button ? system displays the next set of results for the search.
Functional Requirements REQ-1: Torrent search will share the same search bar with the streaming search.
REQ-2: Database of torrent sites can be updated via the internet.
REQ-3: There will be a tick box to allow the user to choose to include torrent searching in the search.
REQ-4: Query will retrieve the no.
"of seed and peers, size of the ?le, date posted and a link to the webpage itself."
REQ-5: If no results are found on a search it will display a message ?No results were found for this search.? REQ-6: Results will be arranged in size/date/alphabetical order by clicking on the column headers.
REQ-7: There will be page button for the user to navigate the results.
The results will be displayed in a tab on the programs main window.
"This tab will be split horizontally into two sections, the top half for the video hosting sites and the bottom half for the video link sites."
This is another ofthe main features of the software and also has a higher priority for development.
Stimulus/Response Sequences User ticks streaming host tick box ? system will now query the video hosting sites in its database when a search is started.
User ticks streaming links tick box ? system will now query the video link sites in its database when a search is started.
User enters search term and starts search ? system sends queries to the video websites in its database based on the search term.
Results for this query will then be sent to the video stream tab in the program.
"The hosting half of the tab displays the website, full video name, length and date posted."
User sorts the search results by clicking once on the column header ? system sorts all results by descending/ascending order.
User ?lters websites they want to be shown in the results ? system removes unselected websites from the results.
User clicks on next page button ? system displays the next set of results for the search.
3.2.3 Functional Requirements REQ-1: Streaming search will share the same search bar with the torrent search.
REQ-2: Database of video hosting and video linking sites can be updated via the internet.
REQ-3: There will be a tick box to allow the user to choose to include video host searching in the search.
"REQ-5: Query to video hosting sites will retrieve full video name, length, date posted and a link to the video itself."
"REQ-6: Query to video link sites will retrieve the show?s name, episode name and a link to the webpage itself."
REQ-9: There will be page button for the user to navigate the results.
So?ware Requirements Specification for x-ray Page 7 4.
This allows the user to use the software with ease by not ?icking through a number of different screens.
In addition to this the user can always see the videos they are looking for.
The main screen will be laid out as in Appendix: B Diagram along with the description of the diagram.
We decided on this type of interface because we felt that it would be very simple for the user to navigate.
"From our reports we found that the simpler the interface was, the more people liked it."
With all these features complied into one screen it will give the software more ?exibility and allows for easy and simple usage.
This will appeal to both naive computer users and experienced computer users with a higher selling market.
4.2 Software Interfaces The software will use hyperlinks to allow the user to open websites in their default web browser.
4.3 Communications Interfaces Communication standards that will be used through the software will be PHP or other such languages.
These will be used to query the different servers that the websites use and will give us back So?ware Requirements Specification for x-ray Page 8 5.
REQ-2: Sending the hyperlink to the default browser will take less than 1 second.
REQ-3: Loading the program will take less than 10 seconds.
REQ-4: Any torrent result with 0 seeds will not be displayed.
1 REQ-5: Sorting results should take less than 0.1 seconds.
REQ-6: A results page will display 100 results.
REQ-7: Any torrent result with a rating of less than 1 will not be displayed.
2 1 ? Any torrent with 0 seeds cannot guarantee to be fully downloaded.
2 ? Any torrent with a rating ofless than 1 should not be fully trusted; this was one of the main complaints from users in William Josephys ethnographic study.
"5.2 Safety Requirements Our development team must thoroughly investigate each website within our database each month, to ensure that no illegal or harmful content is exposed to our users."
5.3 Security Requirements We don?t maintain any user data or host any content.
"In doing so, the site will be subject to full indemni?cation of liability."
"The system we produce will stay within all the legal requirements on our behalf, as our software is only listing links for video streams and video download, and this is not illegal."
Our system will not host any videos.
Seed: a complete copy of the ?le being made available for download.
Torrent: A Torrent in the Internet world is a site that uses BitTorrent technologies to host ?le for P2P ?le download and sharing.
A torrent contains the location of data ?les that can be download from the BitTorrent peer?to-peer network.
So?ware Requirements Specification for x-ray Appendix B: Diagrams 4 3 Page 1 0 5 The ?rst feature of the software is a menu bar.
"This software includes the basic features used in similar products such as new search, close, load etc."
However with our software there are two extra features.
These being a ?lter option which allows the user to set parental controls over the software.
This enables the user to be able to search for videos without getting explicit content.
In addition to this there is a favorite?s option.
"This feature gives the user the option of being able to store links to their favorite videos in the software, and be able to go back to these websites after restarting the software."
This is the main engine behind the software.
This is where the user enters the name of the video they wish to search for.
Once the user has typed in the name of their desired video they can either press the enter key or the search button to run the query.
"These tick boxes tell the software to search for either torrents or streaming videos, depending on what type of video the user wishes to view."
These are the tabs which bring up the different pages of the search results.
This allows the user to run multiple searches and keep different search results stored at the same time.
So?ware Requirements Specification for x-ray Page 11 5- This is where the actual search results will be displayed.
With this the user can then decide on how he wants the search results sorted using the column headers at the top.
