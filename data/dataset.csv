This SRS describes the requirements and speci?cations of Libra, an Economy-Driven Cluster Scheduler.;0
It explains the functional features of the scheduler, along with interface details, design constraints and related considerations such as performance characteristics.;0
The SRS is intended for users and owners of high?perforrnance clusters, cluster management software, job schedulers and grid resources.;0
Scope The Libra Scheduler is intended to work as an add-on to the queuing, scheduling and resource managing module of the open source Sun Grid Engine cluster management system, previously known as Codine.;1
The scheduler will offer market?based economy driven service for managing batch jobs on clusters by scheduling CPU time according to user utility rather than system performance considerations.;1
Hence, the main objective of Libra is to provide Quality of Service (QoS) computational economy in cluster computing.;1
To provide QoS to users, there will be no mechanism for users to interact with each other, and bargain on the use of resources according to their considerations, as is provided in a grid-computing environment by projects like Nimrod/G [1].;1
Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations Cluster/Cluster Computing Clustering involves connecting two or more computers together to take advantage of combined computational power and resources.;0
Hence, a cluster works as an integrated collection of resources that can provide a single system image spanning all its nodes.;0
QoS Quality of Service ? meeting what users actually want, thus maximizing their utility.;0
Computational Economy [2] Computational economy refers to the inclusion of user-specified QoS parameters with jobs so that resource management is based on a user-centric approach rather than on a system-centric approach.;0
This essentially means that user constraints such as deadline and budget are more important in determining the priority of a job by the scheduler, than system policies like ordering jobs according to the basis of submission time.;0
Currently, there is no holistic scheduling mechanism in cluster computing to enable differing QoS levels for different clients.;0
Lin ux Linux is an open source operating system, with extensive documentation and user support.;0
Grid computing refers to using a grid for processing jobs and processes.;0
Bid-based Proportional Resource-Sharing Model [4] This is an economic model that specifies one way of allocating (cluster) resources between competing users based on what their criteria is, such as deadline and budget.;0
In this model, the amount of resource allocated to users is proportional to the values of their bids.;0
Essentially, in a bid-based system, the users are allocated tokens or credits, which they can use for having access to resources.;0
The value of each credit depends on the resource demand and cost at the time of usage.;0
We can modify this approach for our cluster, by evaluating this credit/priority according to the deadline and price constraints of users, and considering the system load and resources use as well.;0
This priority is then used by a scheduling policy to allocate resource proportionally to the competing jobs.;0
Stride Scheduling [5] This is a scheduling algorithm to enforce resource allocations proportional to a user?s priority or share.;0
A pool of tickets represents resource rights to a shared resource.;0
A stride is inversely proportional to the number of tickets allocated to a job, hence representing the interval (in terms of CPU time) between two successive scheduling of a job.;0
Jobs with more tickets have shorter strides and hence are scheduled more frequently and obtain a greater fraction of the resource.;0
The algorithm is deterministic and quite accurately schedules jobs in exact proportions based on their ticket allocations.;0
Process Migration It is the process of moving a job from one computer system to another without restarting the job from the beginning.;0
Sequential Jobs These are jobs that must be run on a single node, and cannot be split into separate jobs.;0
10 Embarrassingly Parallel Jobs These are parallel jobs that are comprised of independent parts that can be split up and performed on separate nodes as if they are sequential jobs, with minimal inter-job communication necessary.;0
They run the same operating system.;0

Overview The rest of the SRS examines the specifications of the Libra Scheduler in detail.;0
Section 2 of the SRS presents the general factors that affect the Libra scheduler and its requirements, such as user characteristics and project constraints.;0
Section 3 outlines the detailed, specific functional, performance, system and other related requirements of the Libra scheduler.;0
Supporting information about appendices is provided in Section 3.;0
Overall Description Product Perspective As mentioned earlier, Libra forms part of a larger system comprising the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system that runs on a LinuX-based cluster.;0
SGE is responsible for receiving the jobs submitted by the user and delegating them to Libra for scheduling and placing on appropriate workstations or execution hosts.;0
Libra communicates its decision regarding workstation allocation to the resource manager, which then dispatches the job to the chosen workstation.;1
Once assignment to a workstation has occurred, Libra is responsible for implementing the scheduling policy on the jobs executing at the workstations.;1
No modifications to the Linux kernel are required.;0
The details of various interfaces have been provided in Section 3.9.;0
Product Functions The main purpose of the Libra scheduler is to maximize user utility.;0
Hence, the scheduler should be able to change resource limits, priorities, privileges and execution order of the submitted jobs.;1
The model is the bid-based proportional resource- sharing model, which will allocate computational time to jobs according to their share determined by the priority of their jobs according to deadline and budget considerations.;0
To ensure that the actual resource allocation re?ects the overall job share, the proportional stride-scheduling algorithm will be used.;1
The user needs to know the exact nature of the submitted job, such as the execution time as well as resources required, and must possess the teclmical know-how to use the interface for submitting jobs.;1
The administrator must be an advanced cluster operator, fully qualified in using Linux, SGE, and the Libra Scheduler.;1
Constraints The current constraints on the project are related to the provision of hardware resources to implement and test a high?perforrnance cluster.;0
At present, a network of four Pentium- III workstations, with a 128 Mb RAM, serves as the cluster, with SGE running on top of the Linux operating system.;0
For better performance analysis, a larger number of dedicated workstations would be beneficial.;0
For testing purposes, a simulating tool needs to be used which may have to be specially designed if a generic one is not readily and freely available.;0
0 A basic module of job accounting and payment considerations will be provided, as they are not the focus of the scheduler.;0
0 Users are assumed to have a fair estimate of job execution times, so that the decision to accept or reject a job is facilitated.;0
Apportionment of requirements Detailed requirements with respect to the economic front-end, that is, the exact costing and pricing policy that will be used to charge users for using the cluster will be specified in a later version.;0
The pricing mechanism will not affect the scheduling policies, as they assume a given cost and budget, and schedule resources accordingly.;0
Furthermore, at present, only a command line Linux interface or the interface of the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system will be used as the user and administrator interface.;1
A GUI might be added once the basic functionality is implemented.;0
It also remains to be decided whether a software tool for simulation and testing purposes will be designed or a generic one that is freely available will be used.;0
Specific Requirements Functionality This section is organized by the processes and features encapsulated in the Libra scheduler.;0
First, three features of the overall cluster management system and its interaction with the user or administrator are described: Submit Job, View Job Status, Delete/Change Job.;0
These are linked to the inputs and working processes of the scheduler.;0
They are followed by a detailed specification of the functionality of the Libra scheduler, which are diagrannnatically explained by the Data Flow Diagrams provided in Appendix B.;0
Appendix C provides the Data dictionary which should be used to interpret and understand the Data Flow Diagrams.;0
This functional feature deals with the end-user (can also be used by the administrator) and is facilitated by the interface of the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system.;1
Hence, it is linked to the scheduler, but does not interface directly with the scheduler.;0
However, the SGE interface will need to be adapted to include additional submission parameters that a user needs to be submit, which are not already supported by SGE.;1
This may alternately be done through a command-line interface.;0
3.1.1.2 Inputs User Information ? relevant user data such as name and authentication id that needs to be used to submit a job to the cluster.;0
Job Information ? about the job that the user wants to submit, as well as already pending jobs, to determine whether the cluster can accept more jobs and can cater to the particular userjob.;0
The job details are provided in the functional feature Initialize Job.;0
Cluster Information ? Cluster Type and Scheduling mechanism details, Current Load Status, Submission Directions and Criteria.;0
3.1.1.3 Processing The cluster decides whether it is even open for job submissions, and whether the user that is trying to submit job is a valid user or not.;0
3.1.1.4 Outputs Boolean ? Whether the cluster is accepting submission or not.;0
Boolean ? User verified or not.;0
Process selected options if choices are provided to the user to View different aspects of job information.;0
3.1.2.4 Outputs User View of available options about jobs submitted by the user.;0
Parameters such as deadline and cost are cmcial to the job scheduling and would not normally be changeable.;1
However, if the user wishes to specify a different output directory or a delayed deadline, this may be permitted.;1
3.1.3.2 Inputs User Id and Password ? to ensure that only the appropriate user is able to delete/change the job.;0
3.1.3.3 Processing Remove job from the queue and update cluster status.;0
Revise scheduling decisions about resource allocation to pending jobs and submission of new jobs.;0
3.1.3.4 Outputs Updated cluster information and scheduling decision ? CPU load, node status, queue length, quanta allocated to pending jobs, reVised expected ?nishing deadline of pending jobs.;1
These outputs are facilitated by the functionality of the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system, and are not independently produced by the Libra scheduler.;1
The Libra scheduler performs it once a job has been accepted by SGE, with information from the scheduler.;0
3.1.4.2 Inputs The information submitted by the user about the job, as well as the job id assigned by SGE.;0
3.1.4.3 Processing Two processes are performed as part of this function: the details of the job are retrieved and then these details are set in variables that represent the state of the cluster and its queues.;0
The parsed parameters are passed on to the scheduling module where the job may be accepted or rejected.;0
3.1.4.4 Outputs The output comprises the set variables that represent job information submitted with a job.;0
Hence, the exact job details are output: Job details ? Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline.;0
The scheduler determines whether the job can be finished by the requisite deadline, given the execution time of the job and the execution status of other pending jobs on various nodes.;0
3.1.5.4 Outputs The output includes a boolean value specifying whether the job has been accepted or rejected.;0
A suggested deadline or cost is given to the user, as a precondition for the job to be accepted.;0
3.1.6 Calculate Scheduling Information 3.1.6.1 Introduction This is the feature of Libra that decides how the job will be scheduled based on its budget and deadline.;0
It uses the Stride Scheduling Algorithm to enforce resource allocations (CPU cycles) proportional to a user?s budget and deadline.;0
It is performed by Libra once it has decided that a job can be accommodated.;0
3.1.6.2 Inputs Job details ? Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline.;0
3.1.6.3 Processing Allocate tickets to a job based on its budget and deadline and the budget and deadlines of all other jobs on the execution host under debate.;0
Calculate the stride and the pass of the job, where the stride is simply the global stride constant diVided by the tickets and the pass is initially just the stride.;0
3.1.6.4 Outputs Scheduling information ? the job?s tickets, stride and pass.;0
3.1.7 Determine Execution Host 3.1.7.1 Introduction This feature decides on which node and on which queue the job will be placed for execution.;0
It is done on the basis of the job?s budget, execution time and deadline.;0
It then selects the appropriate queue based on whether the job is sequential or embarrassingly parallel, budget, etc.;0
8 Dispatch Job 3.1.8.1 Introduction This feature takes the job and inserts it into the queue on the execution host that the scheduler had previously decided it is to be placed in.;0
This is a separate feature since the job may be able to wait for a while before it is given CPU time, allowing other jobs to complete or be scheduled earlier if their deadlines are more urgent.;0
Thus, the dispatcher decides when to actually send the job for execution.;0
3.1.8.2 Inputs The chosen execution host and queue on which to place the job for execution.;0
3.1.8.3 Processing The scheduler sends the job to the appropriate queue and it joins the competition for resources.;0
3.1.8.4 Outputs The scheduled job in its appropriate host and queue.;0
This action is also performed when a job ends and is removed from the cluster.;0
3.1.9.2 Inputs Job details ? Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline.;0
Chosen execution host and queue.;0
3.1.9.3 Processing Libra first reserves the amount of resources that will be required by the job on the node.;0
It then updates the execution host queue status and sends that information about the additional load on the queue and node under consideration to the central information store on the master host.;0
3.1.9.4 Outputs There is no output associated with this feature as it simply performs an update and does not send any results back.;0
10 Execute Job 3.1.10.1 Introduction As long as there are jobs in the queues, this feature is being run.;0
It essentially decides how to time-slice between all the jobs currently being executed.;0
These scheduling decisions are made based on the stride-scheduling algorithm.;0
3.1.10.2 Inputs Scheduled Job ? job details and the queue and node on which that job is scheduled to run.;0
Scheduling Information ? the job?s tickets, stride and pass.;0
3.1.10.3 Processing It looks at all the jobs on the cluster and selects the one with the minimum pass value, and allots it a quantum.;0
The pass of that job is then advanced by its stride.;0
In case of a tie, the arbitrary FIFO job ordering is used.;0
This loop is repeated until there are no jobs left to run on a queue.;0
3.2.2 Maximum bug rate There will be a maximum of 1 bug/KLOC.;1
3.2.3 Maximum Time To Repair In case of system outage, the cluster will be down while the Linux operating system boots up.;1
Deadline sensitivity Assuming submitted statistics for jobs are accurate, the Libra scheduler will ensure that all jobs are completed with a 10% error allowance.;1
Cost sensitivity Under all circumstances, the maximum cost payable as submitted by the user will be the maximum cost charged to the user.;1
Supportability Naming Convention All code will be written as specified by the Hungarian Naming Convention.;1
Coding Standards All code will be written as required by the GNU General Purpose License.;1
Design Constraints Parent Component: Sun Grid Engine The Libra scheduler will be a sub-component of SGE.;1
Software Language All coding will be done in standard C. Scheduling Constraints Exhaustive searches of the entire set of combinations of jobs will not be done.;1
Heuristics will be developed for this scheduling problem.;1
Online User Documentation and Help System Requirements All documentation will be made in accordance with requirements pertaining to open source software under the GNU General Purpose License.;1
Additionally, on-line user documentation will be in the form of man pages accessible through Linux.;1
Purchased Components The entire Libra project is open source, and hence no component of it will be purchased.;1
1 User Interfaces There will be two user types ? the cluster user and the cluster administrator ? each of which will have its own corresponding interface.;1
SGE in turn will be interfacing with the operating system and any other software components it requires.;1
For the execution of embarrassingly parallel jobs, the PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) and MPI (Message Passing Interface) libraries will be used by the cluster.;1
Communications Interfaces Libra will utilize the communications architecture of Sun Grid Engine itself, and will not have any unique communications interfaces above of SGE.;1
Licensing Requirements Libra will be released under a GPL license and will be open?source.;1

Software Requirements Specification for Mashbot;0
This document is the general overview of the software requirements for the Mashbot project.;0
A second goal is to allow for a hands off approach to social network marketing by allowing the scheduling of campaign events to be distributed to social networks. 1.2;0
It is written for the developers, testers, and end-users of Mashbot. 1.3 Glossary ?;0
Furthermore, early stage startups often have small or non-existent marketing budgets, especially in resource-hungry product-based startups.;0
The initial focus will be on scheduled marketing campaigns utilizing social media.;0
This platform will provide a plugin-based architecture for abstracting myriad services behind a single facade, based upon content types provided in common data models.;1
This sub-project will not only be useful to the open source community but will also devalue much of the competition whose prime added value comes from providing such a service.;0
Furthermore, it opens the opportunity for the public to help maintain existing service plugins as well as contribute plugins for new services.;0
This portal will also allow for the collection of responses from customers, fans, critics, and other audiences from these same channels.;1
Users will be able to view social networking messages directed at them, as well as perform data mining tasks on the social networks to provide more intelligent heuristics regarding brands? strength amongst particular markets.;1
The user interface consists of a web front end with tabs to separate the various workflow areas. To create content, the user is provided with a calendar scheduling tool and a content editor.;1
Additionally, there is a monitoring dashboard which gives the user a view on responses to the content in any given campaign.;0
Finally, there is an explore view that gives the user a portal with which they can keep tabs on topics of interest in social media. 2.1.3 Hardware Interfaces;0
The Mashbot web client runs on any computer hardware meeting the following criteria: ? Capable of connecting to the Internet ? Capable of running a modern HTTP 1.1 web browser ? Includes a keyboard and a pointing device;1
? Includes writable volatile storage;0
This allows compatibility with the majority of our user?s machines. Data will be encrypted using TLS and HTTP/1.1. The use of these protocols requires the ability for the systems to communicate using TCP/IP network stacks.;1
The Mashbot server requires no greater than 1 gigabyte of RAM memory.;1
4. Maintain users and approvers of content 5.;0
Set up keyword alerts for ?watched?;0
services 2.3 User Characteristics;0
They should be implemented in the next minor release. 3;0
These requirements are not expected to be fulfilled by the initial release of Mashbot, but should be implemented in the next major release. 4;0
These requirements are outside the current scope of the project,;0
The external email system is to provide a messaging service from Mashbot to the Mashbot users. Priority 2 0110;1
The input is generated automatically by the Mashbot system using settings configurable by the System Administrator.;1
Output The output is in the form of an e-mail to an e-mail account, but it does not return any sort of message to Mashbot.;1
The system categorizes users on the basis of roles and privileges.;1
Within these roles, the system also categorizes users based on the roles that they have within individual products.;1
Roles reflect actions that can be performed by a user.;1
They may also submit these actions for approval.;0
The system may contain any number of user accounts.;1
Priority 1 0260 Certain pieces of information are required to create new accounts.;0
The system requires that a user have logged in before modifications can be made.;1
Priority 1 The following user account information is modifiable by all user types: 0350 Password Priority 1 0360 Email Address Priority 1 0370 Name Priority 1 0380 User Account Deactivation;1
The system allows user accounts to be deactivated.;1
The system denies user who have been deactivated from accessing the system. Priority 3 0400;1
If an account has any history associated with it, it can only be deactivated and not deleted. Priority 3 0410;1
If an account has no history associated with it, it can be deleted from the system. Priority 3 0420;1
A disable account can be undisabled Priority 3 0430;1
It is possible to disable all accounts except for the System Administrator account. Priority 4 0440 Username and Passwords 0450;1

Priority 2 0460 Individual passwords can be reset. Priority 2 0470;1
A campaign has the following components: 0490;0
Name Priority 1 0500 Pieces of content Priority 1 0510 Schedule Priority 1 0520 User/Group Permissions Priority 2 0530;0
A schedule is a mapping of times to publishing actions. It may contain any actions a publisher can perform, and these actions are performed at the associated time. Priority 1 0540;0
The system encrypts data over a direct connection between the web client and the server. Priority 1 0630;1
The system allows for the backup of the data system to local or remote non-volatile storage systems.;1
Incremental backups should not create outages and full backups do not interfere with user interaction for more than 10 minutes. Priority 1 0640;1
The system is configurable to e-mail warnings about multiple failed login attempts from the same user.;1
These warnings are sent to the System Administrator. Other security risks of this type are the responsibility of the System Administrator. Priority 3 0650;1
The system allows only valid users to log into the system.;1
The system allows the System Administrator to configure a timeout after which a user is automatically logged out of Mashbot. Priority 1 4 User Interface;1
The user interface will consist of a tabbed navigation bar that unifies the sitewide navigation, as well as module specific navigation as needed. Tabs: ? Dashboard ? Create ? Schedule ? Explore 4.1 Dashboard;1
The dashboard consists of graphs and charts to give the user a quick view on how their campaigns are performing.;1
Metrics include: ? Clickthrough rate ? Page Views ? Number of Comments Service plugins can define additional specialized metrics to track, as well, for instance ?retweets? for Twitter.;1
A panel is available to give more information on each metric as it is selected. See Fig 1 4.1.1 Create;1
This view allows users to create campaigns and fill them with content.;1
This view is also used when users need to edit an existing campaign. See Fig 2 Add content;1
A user can add content via the add content button near the top of the view.;1
This will prompt the user to select the content type, which is populated by the services the user currently has access to via credentials stored in the system.;0
This will create a section in the main part of the view that allows the user to add individual elements of that content type, each individually scheduled.;0
The content will receive a default golive time of 12am on the day the content is dragged to.;1
If the user desires a different time, he may click the content in the schedule and assign the proper time. See Fig 3 Calendar;1
The calendar allows the user to manage when content goes live, and gives a visual representation of the actions taken on content.;1
This includes the ability to set up monitored searches for services that support keyword search via api.;0
This also will aggregate data gathered from comments on content that has been published as part of a given campaign Figure 1:;0

Software Requirements Specification For Voucher Management System The system will be user friendly with maximum master table structure with all transaction screens to have drop down selection menus to minimize data entry errors.;1
The main data entry screen on claims entry to have drop drown menu from patient?s profile selection to medicine cost to have drop down.;1
Minimize the use of key board for any number entry to have a faster transaction data entry.;1
The system will be easily trainable for the user with minimum computer skill with simple user step by step manual.;1
Storage efficiency: The structural design of the database will have sequential links with surrogate keys.;1
The database storage will be highly efficient to manage and avoid empty unused spaced blocked, properly defragmenter on a periodic basis.;1
This efficiency will have a maximum provision to expand this program beyond the pilot period, if the program requirements remain same.;1
Security: High intrusion controls will be in place in the system and the database.;1
Access level controls, various organizational level user setting by including granular model setting.;0
External Hardware interface: Bar-code ? the system will interface with the bar-code reader to interface all transaction details.;1
voucher number verifications, claim form entry and selection of voucher usage by the clients.;0
Bio-metrics ? the system will interface with the thumb-print reader for verifying claims form used by the clients.;1
This document is purely based on the Functional Flow Diagram designed by Microcare.;0
The document will explain every small entity of the system including various code generations, Bar-coding and Graphical User Interface etc.;0
This document will help the system development team to understand the overall and detailed functions of every small entity in VMU and to design the system that will meet every requirement of the VMU program.;0
This document will help the testing team to prepare the Test Cases and will help them to test every module in the system and overall testing of the system, so that the testing team will have confidence on the quality of this system.;0
1.3.1 about MSIU and OBA Program The concept of Output-based Aid (OBA) Past experiences with development aid showed, that financing inputs, e.g.;0
facilities and equipment, does not result in the necessary improvement of health outcomes.;0
Thus as a change of paradigm, the OBA concept finances agreed outputs with pre- defined quality rather than pre-defined inputs by selling vouchers for STD services at subsidised prices to patients.;0
These vouchers will be refunded to service providers in the private sector (medical doctors, qualified nurses and midwives), government hospitals, NGOs, and faith-based organisations.;0
The approach was successfully applied in the sixties/seventies in South Korea and Taiwan.;0
In recent years also a programme was run in Nicaragua but the OBA has not been implemented in larger scale programs.;0
Basic structures and processes of the STD voucher programme The main structures and processes in the STD voucher programme are: The programme is prepared, implemented and managed by the Voucher Management Unit (VMU).;0
The VMU establishes a network of approved providers (during the pilot phase private, NGO, FBO providers) throughout Mbarara District.;0
The VMU runs a marketing and behavioural change campaign (BCC) to market and inform about the voucher services and how to use them.;0
The VMU establishes and runs a distribution system with the purpose to distribute the STD vouchers to the sexually active population for which the above-mentioned providers are in reach.;0
Distribution follows certain rules: ? The vouchers are packed in two with one voucher for the purchaser of the voucher, in the following addressed as ?client? and one for the partner of the client.;0
? The voucher may only be bought for personal treatment or for the treatment of the partner.;0
Only one voucher is sold at time.;0
The option of selling more than one voucher to a person at a time introduces too many sources for fraud.;0
? Distributors keep a distribution list documenting distributor, voucher number, date, place of sale, and name and place of living of the customer.;0
The client may honour the voucher at any approved provider of his choice.;0
Genital ulcer 4.;0
Inguinal bubo 5.;0
Ophthalmia neonatorum 6.;0
Acute scrotal swelling 7.;0
Pelvic inflammatory disease In line with the NTA the voucher includes ? First consultation with basic lab testing and treatment ? First follow-up visit for all clients.;0
If symptoms persist drug regimen will be switched.;0
? If necessary second follow-up visit.;0
If symptoms persist referral to a hospital.;0
? Provider documents each voucher case in a standardised patient treatment documentation form.;0
? The data from the forms is entered into a computer database.;0
Data checks and plausibilisations are done.;0
? Clean claims will be reimbursed via bank transfer.;0
? Conspicuous claims will be investigated and cleared by the VMU.;0
? The VMU operates a monitoring system including follow-up with patients to monitor proper operation of the voucher scheme.;0
The system will also control the existence of fraud in claims and will help the service provider to reach their payments in time without delay.;1
The other features and details of system will be explained in below sections in the document.;0
The voucher management system is subdivided into following modules to make the system easy for understanding, developing, testing and to implement.;0
Voucher Creation / Preparation 2.;0
Marketing / Sales 3.;0
Claim Entry / Processing 4.;0
Voucher Sales Return 5.;0
Client Feed back 6.;0
Reports (Standard and Customized) 7.;0
Overall Description 2.1 System Perspective This section of the document is going to explain the functionalities of the system, its subsystems and how it?s integrated and working together.;0
During the system study, it was understood that the first pilot period, twenty thousand vouchers will be sold, but the VMU-system has the provision to upgrade to meet the additional market and projects needs.;0
2.1.1 Outline of entire system ? The VMU will create the vouchers and sell it to clients through distributors.;1
? The distributor will submit the sales details back to the VMU.;0
? Each voucher should have two portions with three tear off voucher slips each for Client and Partner.;0
? The client and/or the partner will choose the service provider and will get treatment.;0
? The quarantined forms will be sent back to the VSP for verification, if the VSP returns the claim with satisfactory details, the claims will be entered on to the system, in the following month?s batch.;0
? Based on the payment terms agreed by VSP, the field office will generate Bi- Month or Monthly financial and medical report and send it to MSIU Admin team to arrange the payments for the VSP.;0
? To understand the satisfaction of client the MSIU Admin team will get client feedback from some of the clients and send those documents to field office to enter those into database.;0
As mentioned above the entire system is sub-divided into six modules and again the each module is subdivided into different subsystems.;0
2.1.2 Voucher Management System Modules 1.;0
Voucher Creation / Preparation Voucher creation ? the voucher numbers are system generated and created with unique identification numbers with security protocols in-built.;0
The created unique numbers are then printed out in the form of bar-codes, which will complement (or stuck on the voucher) the voucher.;0
Then at every level on the voucher cycle this number is captured, on distribution, retail sales, point of treatment, enclosed along with claim forms, at the claims processing and finally for the payment.;0
Such tracking records will be utilized for reports as well.;0
Each voucher should have the following properties, which will have sub-elements to get the batch numbers, voucher numbers, and the project codes.;1
Project code ? Group batch code ? Batch number ? Voucher number ? Security code.;0
This validity date can be amended or altered at the system level ONLY by the authorized user.;1
? Voucher will also have MRP (maximum retail price) ? Voucher should have three tear off portioned slips with a sub-section tear-off for the partner.;0
? If the tear off voucher slips would be sticker then it will not be lost on attaching to the claim forms by the VSP.;0
? Each voucher slip should contain the bar code of the Voucher with two identifications one for the client and the other for the partner.;1
? The first tear for the first consultation ? Second one for the first follow-up ? And the third tear off for the final (second follow-up).;0
Design Constraints This system has high security feature as far as the user access to the system, including all the modules, sub-modules and even at the screen level.;1
? The voucher will be created ONLY by the authorized person.;1
? The will be a provision to create a minimum quantity of vouchers at one time (such minimum numbers will be decided by the management team).;1
? Once created vouchers will not be edited or deleted but there will be a provision to with-hold any voucher number if the admin team decides to do for any reason.;1
? There will be a provision to amend the validity date of the voucher.;1
Marketing / Sales The marketing and sales is the next step and the next module in the system.;0
This module will take care of following sub modules.;0
Distributor Master Information The system will capture the master details of every distributor so that the users can get the details of any distributor and sales details at any time.;1
Each distributor will have unique code and detailed descriptions such as name, address, locations and type of business etc.;1
such valid information will help us track information related to sales and distributions.;0
Following fields will be captured at this master.;0
All the level of details will have a master table in order to update as per the program requirements.;0
The system will check the duplicated ID for the distributors.;1
The system can allow the duplicate names of the Distributor.;1
On capture of any duplicate name the system will give a warning message to have the duplicate name or to change the name.;1
For better reporting purposes it is better to have a differentiating indicator on the name.;1
System will have a provision to print the distributor master details.;1
The distributor screen will have a provision to view the Sales History of a particular distributor with following summary details.;0
sales) by double clicking on the grid.;0
Print option of above report is based on User Login Permission only.;0
There will be an option for doing the following at every screen.;1
MSIU Sales Team Information Master The system will capture the details of MSIU Salesman;1
During every distribution transaction the user should select the name of the sales man listed from Team Master.;1
The sales team master is for the future development of this program, if this program is extended to a country-wide network, this master will help understand and tack sales information.;0
Design Constraints The system will check the duplicated ID for the salesman and team.;1
The system can allow the duplicate names of the salesman.;1
On capture of any duplicate name the system will give a warning message to have the duplicate name or to change the name.;1
For better reporting purposes it is better to have a differentiating indicator on the name.;1
Distribution Transactions (Sales from MSIU to Distributor) The system will capture the details of voucher sales between MISU sales team and Distributors.;1
During the distribution the system will capture the following details, to make Distribution process easily.;1
With the below details the user can get the details of Distributor-wise and Salesman-wise and Batch No wise sales details as reports.;1
o Invoice amount = No of vouchers x Wholesale price o Mode of payment is Cash Design Constraints The mandatory information required during a distribution transaction is mentioned below.;0
(Automatic Calculation) The system will generate an auto-generated number as Distribution Invoice No.;1
While entering the No of vouchers required, the system should automatically pick the Batch No?s with voucher No?s from the available voucher stock and list the details of each voucher with below information?s as a grid format.;1
o Batch No o Voucher No o Validity Date The date of distribution will be current (system) date.;0
But the date of sale can be the past dates.;0
There will be a future date sale validation check available.;1
Claim Entry / Processing The program will take maximum care in this form and table, as it become a vital transaction to be captured.;1
In this module you will see that every capture of data will be validated and checked on saving into the database.;0
the capture of voucher number, clinical information, diagnosis details, drug and investigation details and the costs are going to provide the program a vital report information.;0
The system development team will focus its attention in making this module/table function efficiently.;0
For the easy understanding and designing of the system, this module is subdivided into following sub-modules.;0
The division of sub-module is purely based on the sub-level categories of the data information.;0
If any of the information is not available in existing master of above, then the system will have the provision to navigate quickly to its form to enter the master details and back to VSP Screen.;1
The system will populate Active VSP only on other screen during data entry process, but the system will also populate all VSP for report purpose.;0
Activation and In-activation of VSP is purely based on the MSIU Management decision.;0
But if the system is found more than two fraud entries during the claim process of particular VSP, then the system would automatically change the status of that particular VSP as In-activate.;1
Activation of that particular VSP is again purely based on MSIU Management decision.;0
The VSP Master Information screen should have a provision to enter the payment terms agreed between MSIU and VSP.;1
The system will capture following master details to fill the payment terms.;1
o Payment Mode (Cash / Bank) o Bank Account No o Bank Name o Payment Type (Selection from list of options Bi-Monthly/Monthly) The below details may periodically change depends on the MSIU management decision.;0
The system will control the payment process and terms.;1
The allowed users only can able to Add, Modify or delete the VSP master information including payment terms.;1
The VSP screen will have the provision to view the Claim Status of selected VSP.;1
The system will facilitate to show the user following details if necessary.;1
VSP Name (as the report header and below as the details part of report) Claim No Date Date of System Entry Amount Status Remarks Cumulative Total Amount will show in Report footer for the previous payment done.;0
VSP Staff Master Information The system will have the facility to capture the details of VSP staff details and the necessary master information while entering the claim into the system.;1
o VSP Name o Staff Code o Staff Name o Staff Type o Qualification Design Constraints The system will generate message while creating a new staff with existing name, but the system will allow the user to save that new staff if its required.;0
All above information?s other than Qualification are mandatory during the creation of new staff under any VSP.;0
While submitting the Claim (Treatment Form) to MSIU, the system will have the provision to capture the following details.;1
These information is vital and shall be used for compared with the processed claims.;0
Date of submission should be current date The system lists the VSP Name from VSP Master.;1
Mentioned Forms and Available Forms only accept numeric values.;1
Available forms may be less than or greater than or equal to Mentioned Forms.;0
In the transaction part no of forms should match with No of Available Forms The system should print a receipt document based on the information entered during claim submission.;1
The document should have the following information.;0
VSP Name Date of Submission (with date and time) No of claims mentioned No of claims Available The above details would print in the report header and below details will print in the detailed part of the report Treatment Form No iv.;0
Claim Entry The claim entry is purely based on the Treatment (claims) Form submitted by the VSP.;0
Before the claim entry the user should check the form manually to understand whether any mandatory information is missed in the Claim or not.;0
If yes, then the user should mark that Claim (Treatment Form) status as Rejected and send back to VSP.;0
During the claim entry the system should capture the following information.;1
It does not state how it is to be accomplished.;0
This document describes each requirement and the basis for inclusion of that requirement.;0
The intended audience includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.;0
This document may contain terms, acronyms and abbreviations that are unfamiliar to the reader.;0

This section provides a general overview of the system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.;0
The program is focused on demonstration and assessment of data transformation and management, and DUAP system development is a means to that end.;0
From a systems engineering functional viewpoint, the DUAP system has four high-level capabilities: ? Collecting data ?;0
Converting data into information needed by transportation agencies ? Communicating the unified information to various agencies and the public;0
Each representation has its own strengths and limitations, but all are intended to create understanding of the system?s boundaries, components, and interactions.;0
Each representation has its own set of basic units and interactions.;0
One or more of these representations taken together describe the system architecture. Systems similar to the DUAP system are frequently and effectively represented as sets of interacting services.;0
Each service has one or more interfaces by which the services interact.;0
This representation is a very natural way of approaching a potentially complex system with a basic repeatable model.;0
A representation based on services and interfaces inherently leads to a flexible, scalable, and maintainable design.;1
A DUAP system based on a service-oriented architecture will then be flexible, scalable, and maintainable.;1
It will be capable of handling large amounts of continuously streaming data.;1
As shown in the figure, the basic services provided by DUAP are input, dynamic data, computational, persistent data, output, presentation, and administrative.;0
The VII Proof of Concept (POC) input service, for example, will use the X-031 Probe Data Service interface as described by the VII Network;0
User to Service Delivery Node (SDN) Subsystem document.;0
DUAP data input services will send a subscription request to the Probe Data Service, to be fulfilled within the VII network.;1
As infrastructure data are collected from the vehicles by the network, the network feeds the data continuously to the subscribed DUAP services. (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration.;0
2006.) Data available to input services will vary among sources.;1
Input services will also receive speed, volume, and occupancy data from ATMS throughout the state.;1
Archive services will store data from the dynamic data services to support future data analysis and management needs.;1
Checking 2.2.5 Output Services Output services subscribe to analyzed data and format it for use by other services both within the DUAP system and external to it.;1
This could be as simple as structuring data for presentation as a report on a DUAP Web page.;1
It could also build informative messages to be sent to VII-participating vehicles.;1
Due to the inherent flexibility in modular service implementation, presentation services?and the data output services that support those presentation services?can be added to the system as needed.;1
A presentation service, however, would create the user interface.;1
Essentially, administrative services fulfill the role of ?meta-services.?;1
The Director of the Michigan Department of Transportation is appointed by the Governor.;0
The Executive Bureau also includes a Chief Deputy Director, Chief Administrative Officer, and Chief Operations Officer.;0
The Michigan State Transportation Commission is the policy-making body for all state transportation programs.;0
The Commission consists of a six-member bi- partisan board appointed by the governor of Michigan with the advice and consent of the State Senate.;0
The Asset Management Council has a goal to expand the practice of asset management statewide in order to more efficiently invest in Michigan?s roads and bridges.;0
The gathered information must be presented to all users in ?real-time?, meaning that the information is only valuable if it can be provided and acted upon quickly enough to reduce the impact of the event as it is occurring.;1
The information also needs to be accurate. Transportation agency (TA) Operators include local, regional, and state transportation agencies throughout Michigan, and in adjoining jurisdictions.;1
These operators have one common objective, which is to minimize the impact of incidents and events on the normal flow of traffic.;1
These contractors will work with the agency staff to meet the requirements of their contract. Travelers are all the people who use the roadways, whether driving or riding in private or commercial vehicles.;1
They obtain their trip information from various sources and use it to prepare for their daily commute or for an extended trip.;1
The trip information may be used by the traveler for determining possible delays along desired route(s) or choosing an alternative route or mode of transportation.;1
Emergency services are staffed with trained personnel who respond to emergency incidents or major disasters both on and off the roadway system.;1
Their primary goal is to protect themselves and the public during the response to an incident. The data from the roadway system will assist them initially in getting to the incident location.;1
The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) is an example of one such group.;0
It has worked with the Michigan State Police Office of Highway Safety on crash investigation research.;0
It is important that the data used by the researchers is accurate and complete.;1
The Michigan Transportation Research Board (MTRB) is led by MDOT and is a voluntary advisory body to Michigan?s transportation agencies.;0
MTRB will assist in the following: ? Identifying and prioritizing transportation research needs ? Interacting with other organizations that conduct and support research ?;1
Advocating the value of research to improve Michigan?s transportation system ?;0
The intent of adding new data sources is to provide a more complete dataset upon which the transportation agencies can base operational decisions, but there are not necessarily any new users of VII data within the agencies.;0
The providers of VII data are, however, new stakeholders in transportation operations.;1
Once the VII field infrastructure is in place, a network operating entity will be needed to operate, monitor, and maintain the flow of VII data and the infrastructure enabling it.;1
The operating entity?s responsibilities in this capacity are similar to those of a transportation agency relative to the transportation network. 2.4 General Constraints;0
In its prototype DUAP applications, MDOT will be evaluating a broad range of data uses and analyses.;1
Some of these evaluations will benefit from being able to link probe vehicle data directly to information about the vehicles on which the data originates.;0
While this ability is of tremendous value in application research, operational policies will need to be established to protect the privacy and data ownership of the data originators.;1
While the USDOT VII program is addressing policy issues for the VII network itself, MDOT will be faced with many of the same issues as it seeks to integrate VII data into its operations.;0
VII probe data is ?anonymized? to the extent that it is not associated directly with a particular vehicle or driver, there are inherent limitations to that anonymity.;0
In the simplest such case, the VII-originated record of a vehicle?s behavior could be uniquely correlated to a particular vehicle if it were the only such vehicle on a roadway at a particular time and corroborated by other observations.;0
While the bulk of data will be from the VII network, other sources present opportunities for data expansion and validation that might be necessary for DUAP to succeed.;0
Latency enters into the data collection process in several ways: ?;0
The time required for vehicle systems to collect and store vehicle data ?;0
The delay between the data collection and the data transmission from the vehicle to the roadside equipment (RSE) ?;0
The time required for the transmission of data from the RSE to the DUAP system ?;0
Each application using the VII and DUAP data will need to have the capability of assessing the quality of data and making appropriate use of any available data quality flags.;1
While these factors can be controlled during the evaluation phase of this project, only the number of RSE locations will be within the control of agencies during the full production roll-out of the system. 3 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS;0
This section presents the detailed requirements for the Michigan Department of Transportation?s Vehicle Infrastructure Integration Data;0
Use Analysis and Processing System and the associated institutional program necessary to achieve the needs and goals described by the VII DUAP System Concept of Operations.;0
In this section, the requirements are divided into a number of categories as follows: ? Input Services ?;0
The requirements in this document are a subset of the requirements information that is tracked in the system ?;0
Requirements Matrix?. While this document is intended to record the requirements that apply to a particular implementation of the product, the Requirements Matrix tracks all proposed requirements for the product.;0
The Matrix includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the product or which have been deferred due to cost or complexity.;0

Functional Requirements Specification for the Model Manager This document defines the functional or high-lever user requirements for the Model Manager software tool.;0
It describes the main functionality of the tool from the user's perspective.;0
This document will serve as input for a potential Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) document.;0
1.4 Project Scope The Model Manager is a software tool that will allow the user to configure, schedule, run, monitor, and stop (and re-start /resume) model jobs.;0
The primary goal of this project is to extend the current model back end system and to automate the setup, running and monitoring of model jobs.;0
This will include a more automated node management system.;0
Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective With the increase in NSAP projects, staff and hardware, a more automated and procedural, and in some cases, easier way of setting up and running a model job has become necessary.;0
The MM will provide this extension and enhancement to the current model back end.;0
The MM is a stand- alone software tool, which will also be part of the 4DWX OTM system (see [1]).;0
The MM can run in conjunction with the MetVault, and it can also run as a stand-alone application with no knowledge about a MetVault.;1
The MM will be accessible from a web-based GUI and a command line tool.;1
2.2 Product Features The main functions of the system are described in the diagram below.;0
Users of the system will be able to: There are three main user classes of the system.;1
First, scientists and software engineers at NSAP, who will be using the system for setting up and maintaining operational model runs.;0
These are users who are experienced and familiar with the model back end.;0
A second group of users consists of scientists at RAL (and also outside of RAL), who will be using the system for running model jobs for research purposes.;0
Users in this group may want to setup and run customized model jobs, e.g., provide their own input data and own input data processors.;0
A third group consists of users who are less familiar with model setups.;0
Users in this group might want view the status of operational model runs, stop and restart existing jobs or set up and start a 'standard' model job.;0
System Features This chapter describes the use cases for the MM in more detail.;0
The MM will manage jobs on one or more clusters.;1
Node allocation, management and utilization will be provided by the MM (SRS note: The MM provides centralized control over a collection of clusters.).;1
For a user, this has the following implications: A user may not want or need to know how many and which clusters a MM is managing.;1
S/he will submit a job to the MM and the MM will make the decision on what cluster(s) the job will be running.;1
On the other hand, a user might need to submit customized jobs to a specific cluster.;1
In this case, the user will need to have the option to specify what cluster his/her job should run on.;1
Managing more than one cluster, will also allow RTFDDA and climoFDDA ensembles to run across several clusters.;0
? The user can submit a job by supplying a job configuration file to the MM (3.4).;1
? The user can retrieve a job configuration that was previously saved with the MM, change it and re-submit that job (3.5).;1
3.1 Set up and submit a model job This feature allows the user to set up and schedule a model job using the MM's Job-Setup module.;1
Suppose the user is logged on to the system and has made the following choices ?Submit a new job? -> ?Set up a new model job?.;0
S/he is then presented with two more options: ? Weather FDDA? and ?Climo?.;0
Use Case ?WeatherFDDA?: Setting up a real time or off-line FDDA job The objective of this feature is to automate the set up of new real time and off-line FDDA jobs.;0
This use case describes the set up of GMOD jobs, re-runs and case studies.;0
At this point, RTFDDA ensemble jobs will be submitted to the MM as 'by hand' jobs or through a job configuration file.;1
The MM will provide a default GMOD job configuration, which can be changed by the user (TBD: Define the defaults for a GMOD job).;1
It is important to note that the model manager will accept and run ?custom? GMOD jobs.;1
MM's Job-Setup module will allow the user to substitute the default configuration, but it is the user's responsibility to make sure that these scripts, executables, etc.;1
reside on the cluster or clusters where the job will be running on.;0
Submitting a ?custom? GMOD job thought the Job-Setup module will allow the user to save the job's configuration with the MM.;1
Primary actor: Meteorologist, software engineer Goal: Set up and run a real time and off-line GMOD job Action Sequence: 1.;0
User chooses to ?Set up a Weather FDDA Job?.;0
User may choose a cluster where the job should run on.;1
User decides what model should be used: MM5 or WRF.;1
User determines domains (TBD): ? creates own domains (Note: This may only apply to MM5 jobs.;1
From earlier discussions: creating domain files for WRF takes a long time.);0
User defines when a job is to be run and/or what cycle to run.;1
If the cycle time is in the past, then the user is prompted to specify whether the job is a ?case study? or ?re-run?.;1
User supplies other job specific information, such as, cycle interval, forecast length and other applicable information.;1
User can specify whether to write restart files and the frequency of how often they are to be written (TBD: Is this a correct statement and does frequency only apply to WRF?).;1
User can choose between predefined sigma-level configurations or supply own sigma- level configuration 10.User has the option to specify the number of nodes to use.;1
11.User can choose to receive email notification upon start, end and termination of the job.;1
Important note for re-runs, if the input data is to obtain from the MetVault, then MetVault returns the data that was available and used in that cycle.;1
? TBD: Determine standard IC/BC data source and standard pre-processors.;0
Important note for re-runs, if the input data is to obtain from the MetVault, then MetVault returns the data that was available and used in that cycle.;0
? TBD: Define all standard observational data sources and identify their processing scripts.;0
14.Depending on the choice of the model different options are given to the user: ? MM5: The domain size and number of nodes for this job was determined earlier.;1
Based on both choices, the user is presented with different MM5-executables to choose from.;1
These executables have been compiled in advanced.;0
The MM will be able to retrieve the compile info about the executables, e.g., domain size, number of nodes, number of sigma levels, etc.;1
These few executables are standard executables (TBD: determine what 'standard MM5 executable? means).;0
Or, the user can also supply own executable, e.g., its location on the cluster ? WRF: User defines model options (TBD: determine possible model options) 15.User chooses whether or not to run Final Analysis.;1
This may only apply to re-runs and case studies.;1
16.User chooses whether or not to run Prelim.;0
This may only apply to re-runs and case studies.;0
If 'yes', user must specify what output file is to be sent to the MetVault.;0
19.User is given the option to save and submit the job now.;0
Submitting now, would run IC/BC-data and obs processing and the model, no post-processing.;0
20.User chooses whether or not to run post-processing.;0
(TBD: How customizable should post-processing be?;0
In GCAT, e.g., the user can specify locations for pseudo-soundings, cross sections, pseudo-obs, etc.;1
Do MM-users at RAL need that level of post-processing customization?;0
Do MM-users at the ranges need that level of post-processing customization, or would be a set pre-configured post-processing options be sufficient?);0
21.User can save the above job configuration.;1
Job configurations can be saved to a file.;1
22.User submits the job.;0
Use Case ?ClimoFDDA?: Setting up a ClimoFDDA job The objective of this feature is to integrate the GCAT functionalities within the MM.;0
Suppose the user is logged on to the system and has made the following choices ?Submit a new job? -> ?Set up a new model job?.;0
S/he is then presented with two more options: ? Weather FDDA? and ?Climo?.;0
Primary actor: Meteorologist, software engineer Goal: Set up and run a ClimoFDDA job.;0
User supplies other job parameters.;0
User can specify locations for pseudo-obs and custom cross sections.;0
(TBD: Is this configuration information that is only used during post-processing?);0
User picks a pre-configured MM5 setup 7.;0
User sets the time line for the job: start time, end time and what years 8.;0
User sets the ensemble options: ? hourly (TBD: Are there other options?;0
User can request the number of nodes this job should run on.;1
10.User chooses whether or not run additional processing on the model output.;0
11.User can choose to save the model output in MetVault.;1
If 'yes', user must specify what output, e.g., member and/or ensemble output is to be send to the MetVault.;0
12.User is given the option to save and submit the job now.;0
Submitting now, would run the member models, the ensemble, and possible model output processing, no post- processing.;0
13.User chooses whether or not to run post-processing on the ensemble output.;0
If ?yes', then s/he will be presented with the following options: For each output product, the user is prompted to supply a destination host and location, where the output files should be copied.;0
14.The user can also specify whether the members' output should be post-processed.;1
S/he can specify which year-output to post-process and what post-processor(s) to use and where the output files should be copied.;1
The user can specify whether another process (coupled app) should be run on the post-process output products.;1
This needs further clarification.;0
16.User can save the above job configuration.;1
Job configurations can be saved to a file.;1
17.User submits the job.;0
It will also provide the post-processing part of the use case ?WeatherFDDA? in 3.1.;0
Suppose the user is logged on to the system and has made the following choice, ?Submit a new job?.;0
Primary actor: Meteorologist, software engineer Goal: Run post-processing on model output Action Sequence: 1.;0
User selects ?Set up a new 'post-processing' job? .;0
For each of the options chosen in 3., the user can supply a custom configuration file (if this is applicable) or use the default configuration file.;1
User must supply destination location for the output products.;1
User can specify the number of nodes this job should run on (TBD: Is this a correct requirement?);1
User can save this job's setting.;1
Job configurations can be saved to a file.;1
3.3 Submit a 'By-hand' job The objective of this feature is to accommodate the current GMOD-framework.;1
It will also give the user the ability to run customized jobs.;1
In order to submit a custom job to the MM, the user must first identify the cluster(s), where his/her job should run on.;1
Then, log on to this machine, perform operations that are necessary for setting up the job and then register the job with the MM (see Action Sequence below).;1
It is important to note that since a 'by-hand' job wasn't set up through MM's Job-Setup module, the MM doesn't know what the job is actually doing.;1
In order for the MM to accept the job, the user will have to provide certain mandatory information about the job.;1
Suppose the user is logged on to the system and has made the following choice, ?Submit a new job?.;0
Primary actor: Meteorologist, software engineer Goal: Register a custom model job with the MM Action Sequence: 1.;0
runtime for the executable(s) ? number of nodes (??);0
? location of output products (such as: host:/dir_path) Optional: ? frequency of how often the script should run ? job type ? any additional information 3.;0
User can save the job's settings.;1
Job configurations can be saved to a file.;1
User can receive an email notification when job is started, finished or killed.;1
3.4 Load a job configuration from a file and submit the job The objective of this feature is to provide the ability to load a job configuration into MM from a file.;0
Suppose the user is logged on to the system and has made the following choice, ?Submit a new job?.;0
User supplies file name to load.;1
User can make changes to the configuration.;1
User can save the changed configuration.;1
3.5 Retrieve and run a previously saved job configuration The objective of this feature is to provide the ability to retrieve a previous job configuration and to re-run this job or change its settings and run it again.;0

MultiMahjong is a single/multi player Mahjong computer game.;0
This document describes the requirements for the MultiMahjong product.;0
This document formally states the requirements for the MultiMahjong product.;0
These requirements have been prion'tised into three levels: 1. Essential;0
The minimum set of requirements for the product to be accepted (see Section 8). 2.;0
Highly Desirable Requirements that are considered to be likely inclusions to the product, time permitting.;0
This Server/Client architecture will allow up to 4 players to play Mahjong against each other over a TCP/IP network.;0
The MultilVIahjongClient program will also allow 1 player to play in a stand-alone mode.;0
As any game of Mahjong requires 4 players to play, and there may not be 4 people available for a network game, the game will allow users to choose enough computer opponents to make up the required 4 players.;1
In a single player game, the user will play against 3 computer opponents. To play the game, users will use the MultiMahjongClient.;1
The MultiMahjongServer is to reside on a TCP/IP server and will communicate with MultiMahjongClients.;1
The client requires the product for commercial purposes.;0
The MultiMahjongClient program is to be sold to potential users (see Section 5.1.1) and the MultilVIahjongServer is to initially reside on a server owned or operated by the client.;0
This document contains many references to the rules of Mahjong, specifically the Chinese rules of Mahjong.;0
It is assumed that the reader of this document is familiar with these rules as many of the requirements are Mahjong speci?c.;0
"These rules can be found in the following book: Carkner, K.J. ""How to play Mah Jong"", 1993, Penguin Books Australia Ltd.";0
The Existing Logical System;0
The client has no existing system for MultiMahjong. 3.;1
The Proposed Logical System;0
As this is only a suggestion for the proposed logical system, all requirements mentioned in this section are Level 2 requirements. 3.1 Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs);0
The following diagrams show the ?ow of data between the entities of the MultiMahjong system: Note that these diagrams only describe the top level processes and the data that ?ows between them.;0
They do not describe the functions of the MultiMahjongClient and MultiMahjongSeiver programs as the processes are shared between both programs.;0
The functionality of the MultiMahjongClient and MultiMahjongSeiver programs is desc1ibed in more detail in Section 4. 4.;0
Functional Requirements This section states the requirements that relate to the functionality of the MultiMahjong system.;0
Each requirement has been prioritised according to the levels set out in the Introduction (see Section 1).;0
Although many requirements mention that the MultiMahiongClient will send certain information to the MultiMahjongServer, in the single player game, this is not the case.;0
The reference to the MultilVlahjongServer is made to reduce duplicate requirements. 4.1;0
The MultiMahjongServer Level 1 Requirements: 4.1.1;0
The MultiMahjongServer will be designed to reside on a central computer (server) that is connected to a TCP/IP network and has a unique IP address.;1
The MultiMahjongServer will allow connections from MultiMahiongClients and communicate with them using IP. 4.1.3;1
The MultiMahjongServer will serve as a node for MultilVlahjongClients.;1
That is, it will be able to relay data received from one MultiMahjongClient to other MultilVIahjongClients that request it. Level 2 Requirements:;1
The MultiMahjongServer will allow players on MultiMahjongClient programs to chat with each other in real time. 4.1.7;1
The MultiMahjongServer will be able to save preferences to a file and read from that ?le at start?up.;1
Note that all requirements hereafter are concerned with the MultiMahjongClient program.;0
When the user begins the MultiMahjongClient program, they will be able to choose to create a new multi player game, to create a new single player game, to join an existing multi player game, or to quit the program.;1
These options will be available at any stage while the program is running as long as there is no game currently being played by the user (see Section 4.4 for more details about quitting).;1
When a user creates a new multi player game, they must: 4.2.2.1;1
Choose an icon from a predetermined list. 4.2.2.3;1
Decide the number of human and computer opponents they want.;1
In a single player game, the MultiMahiongClient will need to process for 3 COs.;1
In a multi player game with 2 human players, each MultiMahiongClient will support 1 CO.;1
In a multi player game with 3 human players, only 1 of the 3 MultiMahiongClients will support a CO.;1
Obviously, in a multi player game with 4 human players, no CO is required. When a user creates a new single player game, they must: 4.2.5.1;1
When a user selects the option to join an existing game, the MultiMahiongClient will retrieve a list of any games that still require players from the MultiMahjongServer.;1
When a user wishes to join a multi player game, they must: 4.2.7.1;1
Enter their name. 4.2.7.2;1
Choose an icon from a predetermined list. 4.2.7.3;1
Choose which of the available games they wish to join. 4.2.8;1
The MultiMahjongClient must send this join information to the MultiMahjongSerVer.;1
In a multi player game, each MultiMahjongClient must retrieve the following data from the MultiMahiongServer:;1
The name and icon of the player who created the game. 4.2.10.2;1
"The MultiMahjongClient must only allow players to make moves according to the Chinese rules of Mahjong as described in the rulebook, ""How to Play Mah long"".";1
The user's screen is then updated to display these changes.;1
The following game changes are displayed:;1
Another player picks up a tile from the wall. 4.3.3.2;1
Another player exposes/reveals a set of tiles. 4.3.3.3;1
Another player discards a tile.;1
When they choose to discard, the MultiMahiongClient must send this information to the MultiMahjongServer.;1
The wind of the round is also updated (if required). The MultiMahjongClient must inform the user if the hand has ended in a draw. Level 2 Requirements: 4.3.10;1
User's will be able to Save their game if playing in single player mode. 4.3.18;1
User's will be able to chat with each other in real time. 4.3.19;1
User's will be able to change their icons/pictures and names during the game. 4.4;1
The user will be able to end the game at any stage of the game.;1
The user will then be able to quit the program or begin/join a new game. 4.4.3;1
The MultiMahjongServer will inform all MultiMahiongClients connected to the game that the game has ended.;1
Users of any MultiMahjongClient previously connected to the game will have the choice to quit the program or to begin/join a new game. Level 2 Requirements:;1
If a user leaves the game prematurely, a new CO is created on another user's machine to fill their place.;1
This CO will take over the user's current position and circumstance within the game.;1
This CO will play at an ability level as defined in the Level 2 Requirements for the CO (see Section 4.5.6). Level 3 Requirements:;1
If a user leaves the game prematurely, a new CO is created on another user's machine to fill their place.;1
Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. 4.5.9;0
4.5.11 The CO will be able to play any version of the rules that are specified by the user who creates the game. 4.5.12;1
There will be CO's of different playing styles that the user can choose from. 5.;1
The user will need to know how to set-up and operate a TCP/IP server. 5.1.2.3;1
The user will understand the basic principles of networking and know any networking information associated with the server the MultiMahjongServer program is run on (hostname and IP address). 5.2 Error Handling;1
Every error that occurs during program execution can be classified into two types - fatal and nonfatal errors.;1
Level 1 Requirements:;0
If a nonfatal error occurs, a dialogue box reporting the nature of error will be displayed.;1
As the error is classified 'nonfatal', the user will be able to continue the current game.;1
An option to access the online troubleshooting guide (Section 7.2.4) is included in the error dialogue box.;1
If a fatal error occurs, a dialogue box reporting the nature of error will be displayed. 5.2.1.2;1
The only option to the user is to quit the game.;1
All processes will be cleaned up (if possible) and the program execution will terminate. 5.3;1
Implementation Constraints;0
Level 1 Requirements: 5.3.1;0
The MultiMahjong system is to be written using JDK 1.2 (the Java development kit from W). 5.3.2 The coding standard will be the same as that suggested by W.;1
This document is available in PDF in our repository at:;0
A Macintosh operated under OS 8;0
A Unix box operated under Solaris 2.6 or Solaris 7 Level 2 Requirements: 5.4.2;1
The MultiMahjongServer must be able to handle requests in multi player mode of up to 10 simultaneous games (max 40 players).;1
User Interface Requirements;0
This section states all the requirements of the MultiMahjong system that are related to what the user sees and how the user interacts with the MultiMahjong system. 6.1;0
User Interface - MultiMahjongServer Level 1 Requirements: 6.1.1;0
The MultiMahjongServer will have no graphical user interface and will be run using a command prompt. Level 2 Requirements: 6.1.2;1
The MultiMahjongServer will have a graphical user interface with which the administrator of the server can get log information and change game settings.;1
No requirements for this graphical user interface are set in this document. 6.2 User Interface - MultiMahjongClient Level 1 Requirements: 6.2.1;1
The MultiMahjongClient will have a graphical user interface that the user will be able to interact with using a mouse and a keyboard.;1
The details of this graphical user interface are described in Section 6.3.;0
Where it is appropriate, keyboard shortcuts will be provided for mouse based operations.;1
The MultiMahjongClient will have sound effects associated with the game actions. Level 3 Requirements: 6.2.3;1
The MultiMahjongClient will have animation also associated with game actions. 6.3 Graphical User Interface - MultiMahjongClient;1
The graphical user interface (GUI) described below only applies to the MultiMahjongClient program.;1
As the validity of these requirements will not be determined until the design phase, most of them are Level 2 or Level 3 requirements.;1
The GUI is to be designed so that the user can perform all of the Level 1 requirements set out in Section 4. 6.3.2;1
The GUI is to be contained within a screen resolution of 800 X 600 pixels. 6.3.3 All graphics will be in 16 bit colour. 6.3.4;1
There will be a Main Window that will contain the following game elements: 6.3.4.1;1
The Main Window will show the dead tiles. Level 3 Requirements: 6.3.9;1
When a button becomes active, it will use animation to get the user's attention.;1
Document/Training Requirements This section states all the documentation which is required to be included with the MultiMahjong product.;0
This documentation will be available in electronic files, and, with the exception of source code, in hard copy format. 7.3.3;1
The source code will be provided in hard copy format. 8.;1
The acceptance criteria for the product are defined by all Level 1 requirements.;0
That is, Level 1 contains the minimum requirements that have to be met for the project to be accepted.;0
Levels 2 and 3 represent likely and future inclusions respectively, the feasibility of which will be determined during the project.;0
Note that Level 1 requirements may not necessarily be implemented if they are replaced by corresponding Level 2 or 3 requirements. 9.;0
Examples of Behaviour;0
This section describes a possible scenario that incorporates some of the requirements mentioned in this document.;0
As some of the requirements used are Level 2 and Level 3 requirements, the actual implementation of the product may not re?ect this scenario exactly. 9.1 Beginning the Game;0
A user (5.1.1), Bob, runs the MultiMahjongClient program on another computer.;0
A dialogue box (6.3.6) appears on the Bob's computer displaying the options to begin the game (m, M).;0
Bob then waits for a human opponent to join.;0
Another user, Sally, also runs the MultiMahjongClient program, enters her details and selects to join an existing game (M) from the dialogue box.;0
The MultiMahjongClient retrieves a list of the available games (including Bob's) from the MultiMahjongServer (M).;0
The MultiMahjongClient displays this list on the screen (w).;0
Sally selects Bob's game and joins the game.;0
Bob sees that Sally has joined and selects to begin the game (4.2.2.5).;0
The MultiMahjongServer receives the begin game command from Bob's MultiMahjongClient and it initialises all information necessary to begin the game (M) and sends it to both Sally's and Bob's MultiMahjongClients (M).;0
The processing for one CO player will be done by the MultiMahiongClient running on Bob's machine, the other by the MultiMahjongClient rumling on Sally's machine (M). 9.2;1
Playing the Game A main window containing all the game information (6.3.4) is displayed on both Sally's and Bob's screens. Bob, Sally and the CO's take turns in picking up (4.3.5) and discarding (?) tiles .;0
After Sally discards a certain tile, Bob can Chow (?), and a button named 'Chow' in his main window becomes active (6.3.4.6).;0
Bob chooses to Chow by clicking on this button.;0
Bob's MultiMahjongClient sends this move to the MultiMahjongServer (4.3.4), which subsequently sends this move to the other MultiMahjongClient (M).;0
The hand continues in this fashion, with all players making moves within the Chinese rules of Mahjong (4.3.1).;0
After a few moves, the combination of tiles in Sally's hand allows her to Mahjong and a button named 'Mahjong' becomes active in her main window (6.3.4.6).;0
Sally clicks this button and a new hand be gins.;0
When all hands have been played, the Wind of the Round indicator is updated (M) and a new round begins.;0
The game continues in this fashion;0
At the end of the 4th round, Bob goes Mahjong.;0
Bob's MultiMahjongClient sends this information to the MultiMahjongServer (M) which sends it to the other MultiMahjongClient (4.3.1).;0
The main window on both MultiMahjongClients is closed and the original dialogue box (m) is displayed (w). from The Wall. Computer Opponent.;0
The entity that calculates and executes the computer's moves.;0
All the Tiles which have already been discarded.;0
The Tiles at the end of The Wall which are used to replenish the extra tile used in getting a Kong. Dialogue A small window that expects input data from the user.;0
Usually Box contains text and buttons.;0
Discard The tile a player chooses to discard at the end of their turn. Dragon Dragon Tiles include Red, Green and White Dragon Tiles.;0
There are A draw occurs when 3 players go Mahjong at the same time or all the tiles up to the dead wall have been drawn without any player going Mahjong.;0
When a discard is picked up in order to form a Kong, Pung or Chow.;0
This set of tiles must be shown to all players for the rest of the hand.;1
"A player is ""fishing for Mahjong"" when they need only one tile to go Mahjong.";0
All other players in the game must be alerted that the player is fishing.;1
A game ends when 4 rounds have been played.;1
The tiles each player has.;0
A winning hand is when a player goes Mahjong by forming an ordinary or special hand.;0
If a winning hand is achieved then all winds rotate anti-clockwise.;1
Once the player who was the Wind of the Round at the start of the round is again that wind then the round is completed.;1
A hand has to be replayed if there is a draw.;1
These are special tiles in Mahjong.;0
They can be Dragon Tiles or Wind Tiles.;0
HyperText Mark-up Language.;0
The language used to compose and format most of the content found on the World Wide Web.;1
A set of 4 identical tiles. The highest amount that can be scored for a winning hand.;0
A 4 player game which is thought to have originated in China around 500 BC.;0
Also the term given to a winning hand.;0
A set of 3 identical tiles.;0
When a player reveals a concealed Kong.;0
They have to do this otherwise they would be a tile short of being able to go Mahjong.;0
When the player who was the Wind of the Round originally is that wind again then a round is over and the Wind of the Round changes.;1
Software Design Description.;0
A design document to be completed at a later stage.;0
A central computer in a LAN/WAN that allows connections.;0
When a player forms an exact arrangement of designated tiles.;0
To see what constitutes special hands are possible refer to a Mahjong mle book. Three kinds of suits eXist in Mahjong.;0
These suits are Bamboos, Characters and Circles.;0
Each suit has tiles consecutively numbered from 1 to 9.;0
There are 4 of each of these numbered tiles in a suit. Transmission Control Protocol/Intemet Protocol.;0
A set of communications protocols developed by the Department of Defence to link dissimilar computers across many kinds of networks.;0
A 4 sided arrangement of tiles, 17 tiles long and 2 tiles high in the Chinese game of Mahjong, from which each hand is played. Tiles;0
What is used to play a game of Mahjong, just like cards in Gin.;0
Tiles are either Suit Tiles or Honour Tiles.;0
The position which each player is sitting in.;0
Winds include: East, South, West and North. Wind of theThe wind whose round it currently is.;0
This is important for scoring Round and determines when a game finishes.;0
Any alterations to any of the Acceptance Criteria specified above, are to be negotiated between myself and the team.;0
The central part of the avionics architecture of NASA's X-38 Crew Return Vehicle is a quad- redundant Flight Critical Computer (FCC) which is based on Draper's Fault Tolerant Parallel Processor (FTPP) architecture.;0
The FCPs, operating as a single, quad-redundant set, function as the main application processor.;0
The FTSS software provides Scheduling Sen/ices, Communication Services, Time Sen/ices, Memory Management Sen/ices, Fault Detection and Isolation, Redundancy Management, System Support Services, and a Mission Management template.;1
A reduced set of FTSS Communications SeNices will be loaded onto each ICP and will provide an API between the |/O software running on the |CPs and the NEs.;1

REQUIREMENTS 4.1 Required States and Modes Fault Tolerant System Sen/ices CSCI states are shown in Figure 3-1. PowerСon Reset Reset;0
Fault Tolerant System Services States. System Initialization is entered when the system is powered up for the first time, or when a powerСon reset exception is received by the software.;0
Section 3.2.1 gives the requirements for this state.;0
The system transfers to the Normal Operation state after the FCP has been configured into a faultСtolerant computer and enables the timer interrupt.;1
In the Normal Operation state the software meets the performance and functional requirements (other than those listed as System Initialization requirements) in the no-fault case.;0
The system will transfer to the System Initialization state if a reset exception is received.;1
The system will transferto the Fault Recovery state if a fault is detected. In the Fault Recovery state the system is reconfigured.;1
If a single permanent fault has occurred, for example, the system will, when the transfer is made back to Normal Operation state, be capable of handling another fault.;1
Whenever a powerСon reset occurs, System Initialization sha|| [SRS194] perform the following functions.;1
[SRSOOS] synchronize the FCP virtual group in the presence of a power on skew of 2.5 seconds.;0
sha|| [SRSO10] configure the FCP virtual group to use all available synchronized processors, if at least 3 ofthe 5 FCRs are active.;0
If any of the FCP processors are not synchronized, System Initialization in the sun/iving triplex sha|| [SRS177] attempt to sync with the failed FCP.;1
sha|| [SRSO11] align processor state and congruent aligned memory locations.;0
Processor state includes all registers.;0
It also includes those timers used by FTSS. .;0
The FCP sha|| [SRS296] configure ICP simplex virtual groups for each channel in the FCP virtual group.;0
The FCP sha|| [SRS297] wait up to 15 seconds, after configuring the ICP virtual groups, for communication to start from the ICP.;0
The application can use this time on the ICP to initialize |/O boards. System Initialization;0
sha|| [SRS215] call an application initialization function to allow the application to (at least) create tasks, create communication sockets, initialize the vehicle mode, and initialize memory alignment allowance.;0
The FCP sha|| [SRS221], after application initialization is complete, send an FCP Ready Sync message to the ICP .;0
The FCP sha|| [SRS189] wait up to 2.5 seconds (from the sending of the FCP Ready Sync) for the ICP Ready signal.;0
Note that FTSS will not fail the FCR if this signal is not received within this time.;1
FTSS will wait until the normal ICP presence test fails. .;0
The FCP sha|| [SRS243], if the NEFU ICP fails to send its ICP Ready signal, mask out that ICP, but continue to use the NE. 15 297749 Rev F 16.;1
sha|| [SRS199], when all other activities are completed, start the 50 Hz timer and enable the timer interrupt.;0
This will allow the interrupt handler to initiate normal activities. 17.;0
System Initialization, from hardware reset to starting of the 50 Hz timer, sha|| [SRSO15] take no longerthan 1.5 minutes. 4.2.2 Scheduling Services 4.2.2.1 Scheduling Execution;0
The scheduler allows the application to create lists of tasks that run during a given segment of time, at various rates.;1
"The application can create ""vehicle modes"" to designate a unique segment.";1
"The application can also set up ""rate groups"".";1
Each rate group has some number of tasks associated with it, and it also has a rate for those tasks.;1
Note that there may be some number of rate groups that have the same rate.;0
These contain the tasks that will run at that rate in different vehicle modes.;0
Some number of rate groups can be associated with a given vehicle mode.;0
The enabled tasks are then unblocked at the rate given in its associated rate group.;0
An API call is available for the task to call to block itself when it is finished with its cyclic processing. 1.;0
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO17] provide an API call to install a task into a rate group.;1
The API call is invoked during system initialization. 2.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRS196] support up to 20 tasks per rate group. 3.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO18] provide an API call to install a rate group into a vehicle mode at system initialization. 4.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRS197] support up to 3 rate groups pervehicle mode.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRS195] support up to 5 vehicle modes. 6.;1
The FTSS software sha|| [SRSOO2] provide the identical sen/ices in all vehicle modes. 7.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO19] provide an API call for an FCP application task to alert the scheduler of a vehicle mode change. 8.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO20] complete the change from one vehicle mode to the next within 1.02 seconds.;1
There is up to a full major frame from notification of an impending mode change to acting on it in minor frame 0 of the next major frame plus the time it takes during the next minor frame 0 to switch tasking. 9.;0
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO21] process vehicle mode changes during minor frame 49. The scheduler sha|| [SRSO22] execute cyc|ic tasks, providing an API call to allow the application to block until its next iteration.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO24] execute as the highest priority FTSS or application task in the system.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO25] keep a minor frame count from 0 to 49. .;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO27] give tasks priority values according to their rate - the higher the rate, the higher the priority. The scheduler sha|| [SRSO28] detect 50 Hz, 10 Hz and 1 Hz rate group overСruns.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO29] report rate group over-runs to the application via an API service for incorporation in the telemetry data stream. .;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRS181] set the 50 Hz interval timer to a count down value so as to cause the next minor frame interrupt at 20 msec from the previous interrupt congruently in all operational FCPs. .;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO32] issue a 50 Hz interrupt to the |CPs by means of a VMEbus |RQ5 interru pt.;0
The scheduler sha|| [SRS191] issue the 50 Hz interrupt to all the |CPs with a skew no greaterthan 330 microseconds.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO33] send the minor frame number, vehicle mode, mission elapsed time (MET), and separation elapsed time (SEP) to the ICP priorto the 50 Hz interrupt.;0
The NE unique identifier (NE ID) is available to the |CPs via the ftss_my_icp();1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO34] take no longer than 1 millisecond to execute scheduler and Time Services FTSS overhead tasks in each rate group.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO35] provide rate groups that execute at 50 Hz, 10 Hz and 1 Hz.;1
, with a drift rate no greater than 50 microseconds per second, and with a jitter no greater than 330 microseconds. 17 297749 Rev F;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO37] provide a method to schedule tasks at a set rate and in a set orderwithin the rate group.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRS198] execute all the tasks in each of the rate groups that have been installed in the current mode. The scheduler sha|| [SRSO39] rely on the order used in adding tasks to a rate group to determine the task priorities.;1
For purposes of handling exceptions, exceptions are defined as either software or hardware exceptions.;1
Software exceptions are defined as those mapped into VXWorks signals.;1
The scheduler sha|| [SRSO31] provide a mechanism for a task optionally to define a user written software-exception-handling routine that runs in the context of the task. 3.;1
For hardware exceptions and reserved exceptions, the FTSS sha|| [SRS276] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then return from the exception handler to the taskthat was running when the exception occurred. 4.;1
For software exceptions occurring within the FTSS, the FTSS sha|| [SRS277] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then restart the offending task at its beginning. 5.;1
For software exceptions occurring during Startup, FTSS sha|| [SRS301] issue a VME reset to the FOR in which the exception occurred. 4.2.3 Memory Management Services 4.2.3.1 Memory Protection;1
There are two types of memory violations that might occur: 1) as a result of a hardware fault or SEU and 2) as a result of a common mode (usually, software) error.;0
Memory violations that result from random hardware faults will be detected in the same way as any other hardware fault is detected in the FTPP and don't require memory protection for them to be detected and dealt with.;1
In the second case, NASA has determined that however the memory protection function is implemented, the policy will be to restart the task that is executing when a memory violation (exception) is detected.;1
The watchdog timer and ground based testing will uncover some but not all of the possible memory faults. 4.2.4 Communication Services;0
The FTSS communication services provide message-passing capabilities that are layered on top of the packet based network element communication hardware.;1
Messages are contiguous blocks of variable length data that are transferred from one task to another.;0
Messages are addressed with a global unique communication identifier that routes them to the appropriate virtual group (VG) and socket.;0
Associated with the message are descriptor fields describing the sender, receiver, the type of message, and how the message is to be exchanged.;0
The unique identifier for an end point consists of a virtual group identifier and a socket identifier.;1
"This restriction does not apply to the |CPs. ""Immediate"" message passing within a virtual group is not restricted to the highest rate group, but must be used carefully by the application to prevent desynchronization.";0
"Pipe sockets provide ""Immediate"" message sen/ices. Communication services provide a message passing capability that guarantees congruent use ofthe network element among the members of a virtual group under fault free conditions. 1.";1

This gives different stakeholders a view of the requirements that is better suited to their area of responsibility.;0
A Web based solution will be delivered so that users can access the system with their favorite browser.;0
By designing around a standardized language like HTML the application will run on the most popular computer platforms.;0
In addition, a centralized database connected to the internet will allow employees to more easily share information.;0
The Child Care Management software is intended to provide a computer based system that will assist in managing a child care center.;0
Many of the typical functions involved in operating a center will be automated through software to improve the operational work?ow within a facility.;0
For instance, activities like tracking child immunizations and maintaining classroom waiting lists will be performed by the computer system so that employees can spend more time caring for the children.;0
In addition, tasks like processing invoices and printing customer reports will be available within the program to minimize the time that administrative staff must spend creating these documents.;0
This Requirements Specification will describe these as well as many other features of the software in greater detail.;0
A TOP 1.2 Statement of scope This section contains a general description of the software functionality followed by detailed requirements that will be traced throughout the project.;0
Before gaining access to the NCCM system an employee will be required to enter their user name and password.;1
An employeeOs access privileges within the system are determined by theirjob classification.;1
The administrators will have unlimited access whereas teachers and assistants will have fewer privileges as described below.;1
Administrators are responsible for registering new customers so they are the only employees allowed to view or edit all account information.;1
When a parent contacts the Care Center to enroll a child an administrator will ?rst check classroom availability.;1
If the classrooms for the childOs age group are already full the child is placed on the classroom waiting list.;1
The administrator will then create an account if it is a new customer or edit an existing account for a returning customer.;1
As the children arrive in the morning the teaching assistant will record the time of their arrival.;1
Likewise when the children leave for the day the assistant will record the time of their departure.;1
The departure time will be used to keep track of late pick ups so the parent can be billed accordingly.;1
If a parent is unable to pick up their child they may send another person, but only if the person had previously been designated as an authorized pick up.;1
The names of all authorized pick ups are maintained in a childOs record for this purpose.;1
One of the teacherOs responsibilities is to document the behavior of children they supervise.;1
The NCCM system will store this information in a database for future reference.;1
This is especially useful for parent teacher conferences.;0
Teachers will have the ability to add or edit their comments at any time.;1
Administrators can access a reporting feature that generates preformatted documents summarizing key customer information.;1
In addition to printing these reports administrators are able to print invoices.;1
Invoices will include a special notice if a child is due for a required immunization.;1
Customers will be billed on the last day of every month with a discount applied to those accounts having multiple children enrolled in the Care Center.;1
Daily reminders are a feature that all employees have access to.;1
An employee can enter the date of an event as well as a message describing the event.;1
On the day of the reminder a pop up message will be displayed when the employee logs onto the system.;1
Acknowledgement of the reminder will permanently remove it from the database.;1
The following table groups user requirements into various categories.;1
Each requirement is assigned a priority to indicate whether it must be implemented (High) or may be left out (Low).;1
Low priority requirements may be eliminated if it helps meet the scheduled delivery date.;1
Medium priority requirements are not essential and their implementation will be determined as program progresses.;1

A TOP 1.3 Software context There are many key components to the Day Care profession.;0
But the ability of your Day Care Facility to remain in business will be dictated by your ability to manage, facility location, ability to retain children and establish a plan for growth.;0
You will have to manage your facilities in a cost effective, efficient manner in order to maximize revenues per class room yet still remain in compliance with Federal, State, and Local guidelines.;0
This document assumes your facility has already met the Federal, State and Local requirements and will not discuss these issues.;0
The first topic that will be discussed is the current face of daycare in Illinois.;0
According to Department of Child and Family Services in July 2005 Illinois has 287,000 children in daycare 2,918 are licensed day care facilities in addition there are 10,277 licensed Day Care Homes.;0
The vast majority say 70% of these children are in the Day Care Centers.;0
The parent preference of Day Care Centers versus Day Care Homes might be smaller if home facilities appeared more professional to the parents.;0
Based on a parent survey compiled by Childcareaware.com the following are general concerns parents will have when observing your facilities.;0
Is there a child focused staff without appearing to be overwhelmed?;0
Is every child viewed as unique and special individual?;0
Are the caregivers and teacher practices responsive to the abilities of different children?;0
Are special events scheduled and shared with the family?;0
Is there a balance between activities and quiet time and are activities right for each age group?;0
Can you afford to waste valuable resources convincing parents that staff can responsibly address these issues?;0
These issues and more can be achieved via Code Works day care software which will keep facility operators updated with daily activities along with reminders designed to dialogue with parents.;0
Billing invoices, immunizations and other items of concern to parents/guardians are all added to allow technology to ease the minds of facility operators allowing them to focus on staff/class supervision.;0
Parents will also have peace of mind knowing that facility operators are able to ensure staff focus is on the children and not the mundane but important bookkeeping aspects of facility management.;0
Code Works day care software has detailed billing which includes history of payments received, student tuition and tracking of late fees.;0
These features will help the facility operator keep a tab on profit/loss which is imperative for short and long term cash flow management.;0
The hidden benefit is that a profit/loss statement can be generated at all times.;0
Lending institution will want to see this document prior to loaning funds to your business for capitol improvements.;0
According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the United States is According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the United States is in the midst of a childcare revolution the will continue to strain the current system.;0
Dual?earners families can account for about 75 percent of the increased demand for childcare.;0
It is estimated that by 2005, the labor force participation of women ages 25?54 (the traditional at?home caregivers) will increase from 75?84 percent.;0
In addition high divorce rates and the steady increase of births occurring out of wedlock will add to this demand.;0
These trends are similar in Chicago where since the year 2000 at least 50% of all children ages 3?5 were enrolled in some type of day care.;0
Therefore there is continued demand and future growth for this business segment.;0
According to Dun and Bradstreet April 2004, there are 133,020 child care services facilities operating nationally with an average of 7 employees and generates .20 million in sales annually.;0
The annual growth for child care services averaged 7.44 percent between 1898 and 2002.;0
Code Works day care software is leading the way in providing the features necessary to increase enrollment.;0
The waitlist feature along with customer tracking will allow the facility owners to be notified when student has dropped or when the age limitation has been reached.;0
The software allow for discounting enrollment for parent referral and multiple child attendance.;0
Code Works also has the expertise to deliver software using various software models that can deliver continued feature upgrades based upon the growth and level of service your facility requires.;0
National Library of Medicine Digital Repository Policies and Functional Requirements Specification Prepared by the NLM Digital Repository Working Group.;0
In order to fulfill this mandate, it is essential that the Library develop the robust infrastructure needed to manage and preserve a large amount of material in a variety of digital formats.;0
A number of program areas within Library Operations are in need of such a digital repository to support their existing digital collections and to expand the ability to collect a growing amount of born-digital resources.;0
Dozens of digital collections which require long-term management and preservation have already been created by the History of Medicine Division.;0
Collection development and acquisitions staffs are seeing an increasing availability of born-digital materials, including licensed e-journals and web sites that NLM needs to add to its collection.;0
NLM?s preservation program has embraced digitization as a preservation method to replace microfilming.;0
At the current time, these are the only processes that have functionality that addresses the major components of OAIS functionality.;0
The Library needs to put in place a reliable repository for the preservation of digital content not covered by PMC and the videocast project to ensure ongoing access.;0
Preserving digital material presents a different set of technological challenges from those of preserving analog material.;0
The NLM Digital Repository is envisioned as one or more electronic storage systems within which digitized and born-digital objects created or acquired by NLM reside.;0
The scope of the working group?s responsibility was limited to digital repository requirements and issues related to the management of collection materials under Library Operations responsibility.;0
The group considered functionality of software and systems used to handle existing digital collections (e.g., PubMed Central, the Bookshelf, Images of the History of Medicine and other HMD digital collections) in scope.;0
Digital projects, as well as databases, which manage resources that are not part of Library Operations? collecting responsibility (e.g., the UMLS, Visible Human, image library projects in LHC) are outside the scope of these requirements.;0
1.3 Use of the OAIS Model to Develop the Requirements This document provides a high-level statement of the Library?s requirements, as known in December 2006.;0
The requirements are based upon the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)1 .;0
The requirements are documented at a high level, and the rationale for any addition or modification to the detailed OAIS functions has been noted.;0
The level of detail of the requirements varies across functions in this document and is based on the group?s knowledge and understanding of needs at the time.;0
Future iterations of this document may contain additional requirements as they become known.;0
2 Users of the NLM Digital Repository The users of the NLM Digital Repository include both end-users, such as the general Public and NIH staff, and NLM staff who will be working with and managing the content and repository system.;0
A crucial feature of a digital repository created and maintained by NLM will be providing the various access levels required by the different types of users.;1
NIH staff may need different access levels to some materials than the general public.;1
NLM staff and system administrators will require access to the NLM Digital Repository in order to ingest, administer, manage, preserve and access objects and their supporting information and structures.;1
This will require multiple levels of access to the materials.;1
In addition, a primary goal of the NLM Repository is to provide access to the material as an active, regularly used archive, as opposed to a dark archive accessible only under certain exceptions.;1
2.1 End-User Access End-users will need to access and use the materials residing in the NLM Repository.;1
Both onsite access and Internet supported off-site access is needed for end-user access to the repository.;1
End-users will be able to search metadata and full text within documents (when available), and view materials in formats readily available to a wide audience such as PDF, JPEG, and XML.;1
However, some end-users may require different access rights to materials.;1
The 2 major end-user groups that have been identified are: ? General public, including both United States users and international users.;0
Public access to some materials may be restricted by licensing terms, embargo periods, copyright, etc.;0
This level may be sub-divided into location level access when materials are only available via specific work stations or areas, such as the NLM Reading Room due to subscription or purchase requirements and licenses.;0
There may even be instances where materials are available to U.S. citizens and not international users.;0
? NIH staff, including NLM staff, which need to use the repository materials for research and reference.;0
This level may be sub-divided into location level access when materials are only available via specific work stations or areas, such as the NLM Reading Room due to subscription or purchase requirements and licenses.;0
2.2 NLM Staff Access A broad NLM staff level access is needed for NLM staff working with the repository and the objects in it.;0
The 2 identified NLM staff categories are: ? Metadata Access, for staff creating, reviewing or editing appropriate metadata about the materials in the repository.;1
This level will allow NLM staff to view materials and add to or edit metadata without changing the object itself.;1
There should be multiple levels of access for viewing and editing of data based on varying operator and metadata classes.;1
2.3 NLM System Administration/Programming Access The most restrictive NLM staff level providing ultimate rights to the system, required for its management, development, and assigning appropriate rights to users.;0
The following chart of Operational Scenarios and User Classes (Figure 1) illustrates the various types of user interactions expected with the NLM Digital Repository.;0
Ingest Preparation which is listed in this chart is not a component of the OAIS model but has been included as a necessary function for the NLM Digital Repository.;0
Further information on ingest is listed in Section 7.1.;0
? Lack of standards for file types (e.g., e-books) ? Materials found in NLM's special collections may require special consideration concerning the type of formats and data files that must be stored within the repository.;0
Important donations of historical materials may include obsolete or unusual formats.;0
? Bibliographic data will be supplied by NLM?s Integrated Library System (ILS).;1
The repository should provide an interface to this data.;1
? Digital material held in the NLM Digital Repository will be a vital asset for NLM staff and the world.;0
It is therefore important that a suitable set of security controls and procedures is achieved.;0
NLM follows the HHS/NIH security standards.;0
? The Library will follow the HHS/NIH/OCCS security policies for the NLM Digital Repository.;1
? The security framework must address functioning with the NIH off-site remote backup facility (NCCS), in both back up and parallel mode.;1
3.2 Implementation Timeframe Constraints ? Phasing: Evaluation and testing of selected commercial and open source software options is expected to occur prior to selection and implementation of a production repository.;0
? Budget: Budget costs are unknown until evaluation of software options is completed.;1
Depending on the solution selected, funding may be needed for purchase of software and/or additional programming support.;0
? Staff resources: Lack of availability of Library Operations systems staff to work on digital repository testing and implementation.;0
? As new standards are developed NLM will need to review them for use by the repository.;0

A Framework of Guidance for Building Good Digital Collections, 2nd ed.;0
# Assumption 1 The NLM Collection Development Policy defines the scope of the NLM Digital Repository.;0
2 A primary goal of the conversion of content for the repository is the preservation of the content.;1
Priority will be given to preserving the intellectual content.;0
"The preservation of the original ""look and feel"" of the original source will be considered and reviewed on a case by case basis.";0
3 NLM originals will be kept in the collection after digitization.;1
4 NLM will not provide or maintain special software required to access materials in the NLM Digital Repository (e.g., for audiovisuals or computer applications).;1
5 The NLM Digital Repository will contain materials digitized by NLM and born-digital materials created or acquired by NLM.;1
6 NLM will undertake a distributed custodial model for some digital materials.;1
Not all digital objects will be stored in the NLM Digital Repository, but the metadata for those objects will be stored in an NLM-managed system, such as the Integrated Library System (ILS).;0
7 At a minimum, the original normalized object, the most recent migrated version and the next-to-the-last migrated version will be kept.;0
Other intermediary versions may be discarded, and in some cases all versions may need to be retained.;0
8 All digital objects must have an NLM unique internal identifier (UID).;1
9 The system design and architecture should minimize duplicate data entry of any metadata for objects in the NLM Digital Repository.;1
10 Master images and descriptive/structural/administrative metadata that meet NLM?s specifications are created for all digital content that is produced from NLM analog collections and intended for permanent retention.;1
11 The NLM Digital Repository will contain objects of varying levels of permanence, including ones that will not be permanently retained.;1
NLM will assign permanence ratings to objects stored in the NLM Digital Repository.;0
12 The Repository must support the use of multiple languages and non-Roman scripts for ingest, maintenance and access of digital objects and associated metadata.;1
13 Web harvesting functionality is outside the scope of the Digital Repository requirements.;0
NLM expects to use separate software for web harvesting.;1
Harvested data/web pages will be stored in the repository.;1
14 The NLM Digital Repository will not be a dark archive.;1
Objects in the repository will be available for use, although access to specific objects may be restricted to on-site use or for a set period of time due to embargo.;0
15 The Repository system must follow HHS/NIH standards concerning software and systems security.;1
16 To the extent possible, automation should be used for the extraction of descriptive and technical metadata.;1
It is intended primarily as a working document for NLM staff and defines the range of subjects to be acquired and the extent of the Library's collecting effort within these subjects.;0
It also addresses selection issues presented by a range of formats and literature types.;0
The CDM is based on the Collection Development Policy adopted by the NLM Board of Regents in 1976 and amended in 1983 and 1992.;0
The goals of NLM?s digitization program are to increase access to its collections and provide wider use of its rich resources in the areas of medicine, health care and public health while preserving rare, valuable and fragile materials.;0
Because selection criteria for access are often different from those for preservation, the Library has created a different set of selection criteria for each mission.;0
Each approach focuses on all types of materials in the Library?s collections including but not limited to printed monographs and journals, manuscripts and archives, prints and photographs, and audiovisuals.;0
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/psd/pcm/devpermanence.html ? Security The Library will follow the HHS/NIH/OCCS security policies for the NLM Digital Repository.;0
6.2 Policies to be Reviewed ? NLM DTD book formats The NLM Digital Repository will require more expansive, robust DTD encoding for textual materials than is currently available with the NLM Book and Historical Book DTDs.;1
The group recommends the use of the TEI DTD in addition to the NLM Book and NLM Historical Book DTDs for encoding certain text materials.;0
A more detailed justification is included in the report accompanying these requirements.;0
? NLM Metadata Schemes The NLM Metadata scheme should be reviewed to see if it meets current needs.;1
NLM has published an approved metadata schema based on Dublin Core (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/cataloging/metafilenew.html).;0
The needs of the Repository may require a new schema or additional schemas, more congruent with the existing NLMCommon DTD and the NLMCatalogRecord DTD.;0
(Available at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/licensee.html) 6.3 Policies to be Developed ? Migration Strategies/Methodologies A key area identified that will need policy development is migration strategies and methodologies.;0
Policies will also be needed on the decision-making process about whether or when new repository standards will be adopted and when an object can be removed from the repository.;0
An OAIS-compliant repository is an organization of people and systems, which has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a Designated Community.;0
OAIS provides a conceptual framework from which the Library can define the core requirements of the NLM Digital Repository.;0
The OAIS functional model (Figure 2) is separated into six functional entities and related interfaces.;1
For reference purposes the OAIS function descriptions are reproduced using Italic font.;1
The requirements of the Library are documented in non-italic font.;1
A requirement reference number is noted to the left of text that describes the requirement.;1
For the NLM Digital Repository, the process of Ingestion is composed of several different functions involved with the processing of selected material to be added to the repository.;1
The actually workflow for this section will vary, depending upon how and when materials are selected and acquired.;1
Material Submission and Review ? Authentication of materials ? Content inventory and virus checking of submitted material.;0
? Reviewing submitted materials for acceptance/approval ? Reviewing materials for correct file formats 3.;0
All material that is stored in the repository will enter it via the Ingest function.;1
The function must support the bulk ingest of material as well as ingest of individual objects.;1
The materials submitted must undergo several different quality assurance review processes and potential file conversion in preparation for being stored in the repository.;1
See Appendix B for the list of formats categorized by level of support.;0
7.1.1 Receive Submission The Receive Submission function provides the appropriate storage capability or devices to receive a SIP from the Producer (or from Administration).;0
Digital SIPs may be delivered via electronic transfer (e.g., FTP), loaded from media submitted to the archive, or simply mounted (e.g., CD-ROM) on the archive file system for access.;0
Non-digital SIPs would likely be delivered by conventional shipping procedures.;0
The Receive Submission function may represent a legal transfer of custody for the Content Information in the SIP, and may require that special access controls be placed on the contents.;1
This function provides a confirmation of receipt of a SIP to the Producer, which may include a request to resubmit a SIP in the case of errors resulting from the SIP submission.;1
In general, the Content Originators with whom NLM negotiates submission agreements (as detailed in Section 7.4.1) are the content producers (those producing published material, i.e.;0
publishers) and content donors.;0
The Library will proactively work with producers and donors to agree on the content, quality and format of digital material and submission schedules.;1
Some Content Providers may have irregular schedules and will submit material on an ad-hoc basis.;0
The Library will specify preferred formats for the receipt of digital material.;1
The Library may want to accept important digital materials in non-standard formats in case we are able to migrate them to a more usable format in the future.;1
For example, scientific data or holographs may be submitted as part of the modern manuscripts program.;0
Once material has arrived, it must undergo several reviews, including virus checking, format compliance and anticipated content and file type.;1
In some cases, the review and approval step will also include approval of the submitted content.;1
In other cases, the content type may already have been approved and this aspect does not need to be reviewed again.;1
The repository system must include the ability to record all actions and decisions made concerning the submitted material.;1
The reasons for rejection will be provided back to the Content Provider.;1
In some cases, the provider can then resubmit corrected materials, while in other instances the rejection criteria should prevent the provider from submitting the same or similar material at a later time period.;0
When submitted material is approved, it will be processed/prepared for ingestion into the repository.;1
This procedure will include the generation of the Archival Information Package (AIP) that ensures that the material conforms to the repository data formatting and documentation standards.;1
Metadata will be generated, and the components of the AIP will be stored in the system.;1
Data will be converted to accepted file formats, as needed.;1
Two types of conversions that have been identified are: upgrading the version of file format being submitted (e.g., TIFF5 to TIFF6) or converting from one format to another (e.g., JPEG files to TIFF).;1
A primary goal of the conversion of content for the repository is the preservation of the content.;1
Priority will be given to preserving the intellectual content.;0
"The preservation of the original ""look and feel"" of the original source will be considered and reviewed on a case by case basis.";0
7.1.1.1 Allows resources to be reviewed before a decision is made whether they should be retained.;1
Review content as a method of the selection process Accept or reject content or file format.;1
7.1.1.3 A minimal set of identifying information/metadata concerning rejection decisions must be recorded.;1
7.1.1.4 A minimal set of identifying information/metadata concerning rejected submissions should provide a mechanism to eliminate the need to review some resubmissions.;1
Certain reasons for rejection should prevent a possible resubmission.;1
7.1.1.5 Allows notification of producers and donors about rejected content.;0
7.1.1.6 Accepts content from physical media (DVDs, external drives, etc.);0
or via electronic transfer (FTP) from producers.;0
7.1.1.7 Accepts content in numerous file types/formats: TIFF images for storage, XML text, audio, streaming video, and PDF.;0
7.1.1.8 Accepts SIPS in the following formats: XML, MARC, MARC XML, MODS, EAD, DC, TEI, etc.;0
1.9 Accepts the following types of digital objects: Articles, journals, images, monographs, audio files, video files, websites, numeric data, text files, and databases.;0
7.1.1.10 Converts data to accepted file formats [see Appendix B] as needed.;0
System generates an error log.;0
Allows retention of metadata for files rejected but not replaced.;0
Transmission problems allow rejection of entire packages.;1
Other problems will allow rejection of entire package or part of a package, depending on content.;1
Maintains log of messages sent concerning resubmissions.;1
7.1.1.12 Accommodates a resubmitted SIP in case of errors resulting from the SIP submission.;1
7.1.1.14 Stores and tracks versions of a document/file/image.;1
Links /connections between versions are created and maintained.;1
7.1.1.15 Assigns a unique identifier to each object.;1
7.1.1.16 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.;1
7.1.2 Quality Assurance The Quality Assurance function validates (QA results) the successful transfer of the SIP to the staging area.;1
For digital submissions, these mechanisms might include Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) or checksums associated with each data file, or the use of system log files to record and identify any file transfer or media read/write errors.;1
The purpose of Quality Assurance (QA) is to assure the Library that digital material is of sufficient quality to be stored in the NLM Digital Repository.;0
Since manual QA is very time-consuming, QA activities should be as automated as possible, with the ability to override for manual QA when needed.;1
Manual QA processes must be adjustable depending upon the origin of the file, which could dictate the level of QA required.;1
7.1.2.1 Performs virus checking on SIP.;0
7.1.2.2 Validates automatically the successful transfer of the SIP to a staging area using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRCs) or checksums associated with each data file.;0
7.1.2.3 Verifies the validity of the submission based on submitter, expected format, file quality, duplication (e.g., existence of object in repository), and completeness.;0
7.1.2.4 Allows NLM staff to display and perform manual/visual quality control assurance on staged SIPs via a user-friendly GUI interface.;0
7.1.2.5 Any QA errors shall prompt a request for resubmission and/or internal action.;0
? Internal action may result in creation of a digital object in another preferred format.;0
7.1.2.6 Allows NLM staff to accept or reject the SIPs at file or batch level.;0
7.1.2.7 Generates statistical and error reports.;0
7.1.2.8 Ability to adjust the level of manual quality control needed based on the origin of the file.;1
7.1.2.9 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.;0
7.1.3 Generate Archival Information Package (AIP) The Generate AIP function transforms one or more SIPs into one or more AIPs that conform to the archive?s data formatting and documentation standards.;1
This may involve file format conversions, data representation conversions or reorganization of the content information in the SIPs.;1
The Generate AIP function may issue report requests to Data Management to obtain reports of information needed by the Generate AIP function to produce the Descriptive Information that completes the AIP.;0
This function sends SIPs or AIPs for audit to the Audit Submission function in Administration, and receives back an audit report.;0
Archival Information Packets (AIP) are information packets of content converted to the archive standards identified in Appendix B.;0
Generating the AIPs deals with transforming or repackaging of data to the current NLM archival standards.;0
The system also provides reports containing metadata that may be used in later processes and functions.;1
The Library will develop policies that govern where the individual components of an AIP are stored.;1
"The policy may vary dependent upon a number of factors; for example, the type of digital object, access rights, and conditions of use.";1
7.1.3.1 Generates AIPs for Repository Storage by transforming SIPs to conform to repository?s data formatting standards.;0
7.1.3.4 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.;0
7.1.3.5 Converts data as described in 7.1.1.10.;0
7.1.3.6 AIPs may consist of both masters files and derivatives.;1
This includes metadata to support searching and retrieving AIPs (e.g., who, what, when, where, why), and could also include special browse products (thumbnails, images) to be used by Finding Aids.;0
NLM broadly interprets the term Descriptive Information to include descriptive, administrative and structural metadata needed for retrieval and management of digital objects (See Appendix C for metadata definitions.);0
Metadata is generated during the Generate Archival Information Package functions.;0
7.1.4.1 Allows entry and validation of additional metadata (e.g.;0
subject headings, names, dates, ?curatorial? descriptive metadata - evaluative information that explains why an object is important, whether it was part of a larger collection (e.g., an exhibit), etc.).;0
? Basic descriptive metadata will also be stored with the objects (e.g., unique identifier, title and date stored in the TIFF header) so that the objects can still be identified in the event that information in the database is corrupted.;1
? See Appendix D for examples of TIFF header metadata requirements.;0
7.1.4.7 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.;0
7.1.5 Coordinate Updates The Coordinate Updates function is responsible for transferring the AIPs to Archival Storage and the Descriptive Information to Data Management.;0
Transfer of the AIP includes a storage request and may represent an electronic, physical, or a virtual (i.e., data stays in place) transfer.;1
After the transfer is completed and verified, Archival Storage returns a storage confirmation indicating (or verifying) the storage identification information for the AIP.;0
The Coordinate Updates function also incorporates the storage identification information into the Descriptive Information for the AIP and transfers it to the Data Management entity along with a database update request.;1
In return, Data Management provides a database update response indicating the status of the update.;1
Data Management updates may take place without a corresponding Archival Storage transfer when the SIP contains Descriptive Information for an AIP already in Archival Storage.;1
The individual components of an AIP may be physically stored in different locations within the repository.;1
The Coordinate Updates function transfers components of the AIP to the relevant storage locations, and maintains a record of the location of the components.;1
7.1.5.1 Transfers the AIPs to Archival Storage.;0
? Includes a storage request which provides a storage confirmation for the AIP.;0
7.1.5.2 Transfers the Descriptive Information to Data Management.;0
7.1.5.3 Sends confirmation notification when transfer to archival storage is completed.;0
7.1.5.4 Stores the identification information in the Data Management database to support search and retrieval of AIPs in Archive Storage.;0
? Identifiers are the link between Data Management and digital objects.;0
7.1.5.5 AIPS and Descriptive Information will be put back together when objects are accessed.;0
7.1.5.6 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.;0
7.2 Archival Storage Archival Storage provides the services and functions for the storage, maintenance and retrieval of AIPs.;0
7.2.1 Receive Data The Receive Data function receives a storage request and an AIP from Ingest and moves the AIP to permanent storage within the archive.;1
The transfer request may need to indicate the anticipated frequency of utilization of the data objects comprising the AIP in order to allow the appropriate storage devices or media to be selected for storing the AIP.;0
This function will select the media type, prepare the devices or volumes, and perform the physical transfer to the Archival Storage volumes.;1
Upon completion of the transfer, this function sends a storage confirmation message to Ingest, including the storage identification of the AIPs.;0
7.2.1.1 Receives AIPs from Ingest.;0
7.2.1.4 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.;0
It will also conform to any special levels of service required for the AIP, or any special security measures that are required, and ensures the appropriate level of protection for the AIP.;1
These include on-line, off-line or near-line storage, required throughput rate, maximum allowed bit error rate, or special handling or backup procedures.;0
It monitors error logs to ensure AIPs are not corrupted during transfers.;0
This function also provides operational statistics to Administration summarizing the inventory of media on-hand, available storage capacity in the various tiers of the storage hierarchy, and usage statistics.;1
7.2.2.1 Monitors and ensures that AIPs are not corrupted during transfers.;1
7.2.2.2 Conforms to NLM security policies and requirements to ensure the appropriate level of protection for the AIPs.;1
7.2.2.3 Keeps an audit trail of all actions.;0
7.2.3 Replace Media The Replace Media function provides the capability to reproduce the AIPs over time.;1
Within the Replace Media function the Content Information and Preservation Description Information (PDI) must not be altered.;1
However, the data constituting the Packaging Information may be changed as long as it continues to perform the same function and there is a straightforward implementation that does not cause information loss.;0
The migration strategy must select a storage medium, taking into consideration the expected and actual rates of errors encountered in various media types, their performance, and their costs of ownership.;1
Anticipating the terminology of section 0, this function may perform Refreshment, Replication, and Repackaging that is straightforward.;1
An example of such Repackaging is migration to new media under a new operating system and file system, where the Content Information and PDI are independent of the file systems.;0
However, complex repackaging and all transformation are performed under Administration supervision by the Archival Information Update function to ensure information preservation.;0
7.2.3.1 Able to refresh/replace the media on which repository holdings are stored without service interruption, and update corresponding metadata as appropriate.;1
7.2.3.2 Able to ensure that Content Information and Preservation Description Information (PDI) are not altered.;1
7.2.4 Error Checking and Disaster Recovery The Error Checking function provides statistically acceptable assurance that no components of the AIP are corrupted during any internal Archival Storage data transfer.;1
This function requires that all hardware and software within the archive provide notification of potential errors and that these errors are routed to standard error logs that are checked by the Archival Storage staff.;1
The PDI Fixity Information provides some assurance that the Content Information has not been altered as the AIP is moved and accessed.;0
Similar information is needed to protect the PDI itself.;0
A standard mechanism for tracking and verifying the validity of all data objects within the archive may also be used.;0
For example, CRCs could be maintained for every individual data file.;0
A higher level of service, such as Reed-Solomon coding to support combined error detection and correction, could also be provided.;0
The storage facility procedures should provide for random verification of the integrity of data objects using CRCs or some other error checking mechanism.;1
The Disaster Recovery function provides a mechanism for supplicating the digital contents of the archive collection and storing the duplicate in a physically separate facility.;1
This function is normally accomplished by copying the archive contents to some form of removable storage media (e.g.;0
The details of disaster recovery policies are specified by Administration.;0
Error Checking provides statistically accepted assurance to ensure that none of an AIP?s components are corrupted via any internal storage function.;0
The NLM Repository system must be compatible with and conform to the requirements of the NIH Consolidated Collocation Site (NCCS), NLM's off-site back-up facility.;1
7.2.4.1 Provides statistically acceptable assurance that no components of the AIP are corrupted during any internal Archival Storage data transfer.;1
7.2.4.2 Performs routine and special data integrity checking such as Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) or checksums for each individual file and generates error reports.;1
7.2.4.3 Provides disaster recovery capabilities including data backup, off-site data storage, data recovery, etc.;1
7.2.5 Provide Data The Provide Data function provides copies of stored AIPs to Access.;1
This function receives an AIP request that identifies the requested AIP(s) and provides them on the requested media type or transfers them to a staging area.;1
This function also sends a notice of data transfer to Access upon completion of an order.;1
The Provide Data function provides AIP components to Access.;1
See Section 7.6 for issues concerning Access and Rights Management.;0
7.2.5.1 Provides AIPs to Access to generate Dissemination Information Packages (DIPs).;1
7.3.1 Administer Database The Administer Database function is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the Data Management database, which contains both Descriptive Information and system information.;1
Descriptive Information identifies and describes the archive holdings, and system information is used to support archive operations.;0

Introduction This document de?nes the functional requirements of the Number Portability Administration Center Service Management System (NPAC SMS) enabling Service Provider Portability.;0
This introduction gives readers a brief overview of NPAC SMS functionality.;0
It is intended to prepare you for the detailed sections that follow.;0
If you need more information on any particular area, please consult the applicable detailed sections in the remainder of this document or the NPAC SMS Interoperable Interface Speci?cation.;0
This introduction is also meant to convey the basic course of events that give the best understanding of the system.;0
The NPAC SMS also contains a record of all ported numbers and a history ?le of all transactions relating to the porting of a number.;0
The NPAC SMS shall also provide audit functionality and the ability to transmit LNP routing information to Service Providers to maintain synchronization of Service Provider?s network elements that support LNP.;0
Both the old and new Service Providers can send a noti?cation to the NPAC SMS from their Service Order Administration Systems (SOA).;0
When the NPAC SMS receives the noti?cation(s), it will perform certain validation checks, and attempt to match the noti?cation received from the new Service Provider with a concurring noti?cation that may be sent from the old Service Provider.;0
Assuming the noti?cations are valid, the two Service Providers will complete any physical changes required.;0
When the new Service Provider due date is reached, the new Service Provider can send an activation notice to the NPAC SMS.;0
The NPAC SMS will broadcast the update out in real time to each local SMS.;0
Upon receiving the update from the NPAC SMS, all Service Providers will update their networks.;1
The NPAC SMS will record any transmission failures and take the appropriate action.;1
If it then receives the missing noti?cation and the noti?cations indicate agreement among the Service Providers, the process proceeds as normal.;0
If it was the new Service Provider that failed to respond, the NPAC will log the failure to respond, cancel the request, and notify both Service Providers of the cancellation.;1
If there is disagreement among the Service Providers as to who will be providing service for the telephone number, the con?ict resolution procedures will be implemented (see Section 1.2.4).;1
Processes for obtaining authorization from the customer to port a number are de?ned by the Service Providers.;1
The NPAC is not involved in obtaining or verifying customer approval to port a TN.;0
1.2.2Disconnect Service Functionality When a ported number is being disconnected, the customer and Service Provider will agree on a date.;1
The current Service Provider will send an update indicating the disconnect to the NPAC SMS.;1
The NPAC SMS will broadcast the update to all Service Providers based on the disconnect effective date and remove the telephone number from its database of ported numbers.;1
Upon receiving the update, all Service Providers will remove the telephone number from their LNP databases.;1
The NPAC SMS will log the update in history.;1
Calls to the telephone number will be routed as a non-ported number.;1
1.2.3Repair Service Functionality A problem will be detected either by a Service Provider or by a customer contacting a Service Provider.;1
There will be audit capabilities in the NPAC SMS to aid in isolating problems.;1
If an inaccuracy is found, the NPAC SMS will supply the correct data to any local SMS requesting updates.;1
The Service Providers will determine who will serve the customer Via internal processes.;1
When a resolution is reached, the NPAC will be noti?ed and will remove the request from the ?con?ict? state by the new Service Provider.;1
The new Service Provider can cancel the Subscription Version.;1
1.2.5Disaster Recovery and Backup Functionality If there is unplanned downtime, the NPAC will assess how long the primary machine will be down.;1
The NPAC will notify all of the Service Providers of the situation and planned action by electronic noti?cation and telephone calls to the Service Providers? contact numbers.;1
The Service Providers will attempt to switch to the backup NPAC.;1
If a Create Subscription has been sent by only the old Service Provider, the old Service Provider may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version.;1
If both Service Providers have sent a Create Subscription, either may send a message to the NPAC SMS to cancel the Subscription Version.;1
If both Service Providers concur with the cancellation, the NPAC SMS will set the Subscription Version to canceled and notify both Service Providers that the Subscription Version has been canceled.;1
If cancellation concurrence is not provided by the new Service Provider the Subscription Version is placed in con?ict by the NPAC SMS.;1
If cancellation concurrence is not provided by the old Service Provider, the Subscription Version is set to cancel by the NPAC SMS.;1
1.2.7Audit Request Functionality An audit function will be necessary for troubleshooting customer problems and also as a maintenance process to ensure Subscription Version data integrity across the entire LNP network.;1
Audits will be concerned with the process of comparing the NPAC SMS View of the LNP network?s Subscription Version data with one or more of the Service Provider?s Views of its network.;1
In the case of ?on demand? audits, audits may be initiated by any Service Provider who has reason to believe a problem may eXist in another Service Provider?s network.;1
These audits are executed Via queries to the appropriate Service Provider?s network, and corrected Via downloads to those same networks.;1
In addition, Local Service Providers will be responsible for comparing database extracts of Subscription data written to an FTP site by the NPAC SMS with their own versions of the same Subscription data.;1
In a third scenario, the NPAC SMS will select a random sample of active Subscription Versions from its own database, then compare those samples to the representation of that same data in the various Local SMS databases.;1
All three of the methods outlined above are designed to help ensure data integrity across the LNP network.;1
1.2.8Report Request Functionality The NPAC SMS supports report generation for pre-de?ned and ad-hoc reports.;1
The report generation function creates output report ?les according to speci?ed format de?nitions, and distributes reports to output devices as requested.;1
The report distribution service supports distribution to electronic ?les local/remote printers, e-mail and FAX machines.;1
1.2.9Data Management Functionality The NPAC SMS will support functionality to manage network, Service Provider, and Subscription Version data.;1
1.2.9.1NPAC Network Data The NPAC SMS contains data, which de?nes the con?guration of the LNP service and network.;1
This includes such data as: participating Service Providers, NPA-NXXs that are portable, and LRNs associated with each Service Provider.;1
1.2.9.3Subscription Version Data The subscription data indicates how local number portability should operate to meet subscribers? needs.;1
The NPAC inputs Via the NPAC Administrative Interface the information for the NPA split (the current NPA, the new NPA, and the affected NXXs) plus the beginning and end date of the permissive dialing period.;1
This function of the NPAC Administrative Interface is only available to NPAC Operations personnel.;1
The NPAC will update its subscription version records when permissive dialing starts to the new NPA.;1
During the permissive dialing period the NPAC will accept messages with either old or new NPA but broadcasts/downloads with the new NPA only.;1
In addition, all noti?cations and responses to the SOA system will contain the new NPA only during the permissive dialing period regardless of whether the SOA system is using the old or new NPA in its requests to the NPAC SMS.;1
If a delete request is received, it is broadcast with the new NPA.;1
The subscription version ID that the NPAC SMS is aware of for the TN is used in the messages.;1
Based on information from the LERG, the service providers will update their networks/LSMS to accommodate the permissive dialing period and will update the data in their networks/LSMS after permissive dialing ends.;1
There is no communication from the NPAC to cause these updates to occur.;1
No assumptions are made about what the LSMS does during the permissive period to track the NPA-NXX split for a subscription version.;1
Additionally, the service providers can remove any old LRNs that are no longer valid due to the split, if any, Via an electronic interface (SOA, LSMS, or NPAC Administrative Interface).;1
The two types are long and short business days/hours.;1
version port short business days/ hours will be used.;1
No action is necessary by either the old or new service provider The old service provider who operations personnel.;1
supports the long business days/hours will have to recognize that the short business days/hours are being used instead of the expected long business days/hours.;1
Long When the new service provider When both the old and new supports long business service providers support long days/hours and the old service timers for a subscription version providers supports short port long timers will be used.;1
business days/hours for a subscription version port short No action is necessary by either business days/hours will be the old or new service provider used.;1
The new service provider who supports the long business days/hours will have to recognize that the short timers are being used instead of the expected long timers.;1
The two types are long and short timers.;1
No action is necessary by either the old or new service provider The new service provider who operations personnel.;1
supports the short timers will have to recognize that the long timers are being used instead of the expected short timers.;1
No action is necessary by either The old service provider who the old or new service provider supports the short timers will operations personnel.;1
The SOA requests network data and noti?cation data for a speci?c period of time from the NPAC SMS, which is sent by the NPAC SMS as requested.;1
During the recovery process, new messages are queued on the NPAC SMS.;1
At the completion of sending the previously queued messages, the interaction between the SOA and the NPAC SMS resumes for normal message processing.;1
The LSMS recovery functionality works similar to the SOA, with the addition of recovering subscription data.;1
The processing steps for this functionality include: 1.;0
The Service Provider system sends a network data recovery request to the NPAC.;1
The NPAC takes the time range in the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value.;1
If the time range exceeds the tunable value, a DownloadReply is returned to the SP system with the status ?eld populated with value 2, signifying ?time-range-invalid?.;1
No network data will be included with this reply.;1
When an SP system sees this response, the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the network data recovery action and re-issue the request.;1
The processing steps for this functionality include: 1.;1
The Service Provider system sends a subscription data recovery request to the NPAC.;1
The NPAC takes the time range in the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value.;1
If the time range exceeds the tunable value, a DownloadReply is returned to the SP system with the status ?eld populated with value 2, signifying ?time-range-invalid?.;1
No subscription data will be included with this reply.;1
When an SP system sees this response, the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the subscription data recovery action and re-issue the request.;1
1.2.13.3 Notification Recovery Noti?cation Recovery in the NPAC SMS allows a Service Provider for both SOA and LSMS to capture, Via a recovery process, all noti?cations that were missed during a downtime period for the Service Provider.;1
The Service Provider system sends a noti?cation recovery request to the NPAC.;1
The NPAC retrieves the records that match the requested criteria, and compares the number to the current tunable value.;1
No noti?cations will be included with this reply.;1
When an SP system sees this response, the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the noti?cation recovery action and re-issue the request.;1
1.2.14 Number Pooling Overview At the present time, the National Number Pooling approach includes the following: 1.;1
The NPA-NXX-X Holder Information in the NPAC is a representation of the 1K Block managed by the Pooling Administrator, and represented in the LERG.;1
The NPAC Customer Data Model (logical) and Service Provider Pro?le (physical) refer to the same information.;1
At the time of NPA-NXX-X creation, the NPAC will check for ?pending-like, no-active? SVs or ?pending- like Port?To-Original? SVs.;1
If any are found, the NPAC will reject the creation of this NPA-NXX-X.;1
An error message will be generated for the NPAC personnel.;1
The Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port?to-Original Subscription Version report will be available to NPAC personnel.;1
The report will contain TN, Old SPID, New SPID, Due Date, and Status.;1
Once the NPA-NXX-X?s Effective Date has been reached, but prior to the Block?s activation, snapback messages will go to the Block Holder, and default routing will be the responsibility of the Code Holder.;1
The exception to this is during the de-pool process for the NPA-NXX-X (see #31 below).;0
The Block Holder Information?s ?Activation Timestamp? is the date/time the NPAC broadcasts block or SV data to the applicable LSMSs.;0
Only at this point in time are all SPs noti?ed of the ?ownership switchover? date for the 1K Block from the Code Holder (NPA-NXX owning SP) to the Block Holder (NPA-NXX-X owning SP).;1
Block Create messages over the SOA-to-NPAC SMS Interface will set the SOA Origination to TRUE.;1
The Block Holder Information?s SOA noti?cation is broadcast over the SOA to NPAC Interface, when the SOA Origination on the Block record is set to TRUE.;1
At the time of Block creation by the NPAC (attempted on or after the NPA-NXX-X?s Effective Date), the NPAC will check for ?pending-like, no-active? SVs.;1
If any are found, the NPAC will reject the creation of this Block.;1
A unique alarmable error message (new error message and error number for Block) will be generated and alarm NPAC personnel.;1
At the time of Block creation by the SP's SOA (attempted on or after the NPA-NXX-X?s Effective Date), the NPAC will check for ?pending-like, no-active? SVs.;1
If any are found, the NPAC will reject the creation of this Block.;1
A unique alarmable error message (new error message and error number for Block, but no alarm to NPAC Personnel) will be generated and sent back to the SP?s SOA.;1
A new M&P will require the SP to contact NPAC personnel (USA) and request the generation of the Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port?to-Original Subscription Version report.;1
The Pending-Like No-Active Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port?to-Original Subscription Version report will be created and will contain TN, Old SPID, New SPID, Due Date, and Status.;1
Once they are cleaned up, NPAC personnel will attempt the Block creation again (if it is NPAC initiated), or contact the Block Holder SP and inform them that they could re-submit the Block request.;1
M&P will be established to have NPAC Personnel resolve the broadcast failures with the Service Providers on the Block?s Failed SP List.;1
The NPAC will execute a background process, once a day, to check for Block completeness.;1
During this background process, the NPAC will check for active blocks that haven?t been veri?ed to contain 1000 SVs (combination of POOL, LISP, LSPP) for that Block..;1
This background process will be run for the ?rst time within 24 hours of Block Creation (with an Active status), and once every 24 hours thereafter for incomplete Blocks.;1
For missing TNs that are identi?ed during this process, the NPAC will create, activate and broadcast the missing SVs to non-EDR Local SMSs (i.e., self-?Xing create, activate and broadcast of missing SVs).;1
Once all 1000 TNs have been accounted for in the NPAC, this Block will no longer be checked by the NPAC.;1
The NPAC will manage the synchronization of, and maintain the integrity of, the data between a Block and the subordinate Pooled Subscription Versions within the Block.;1
This means that, at all times, the LRN and GTT routing data for the Block and all SVs with LNP Type of POOL within the 1K Block, will contain the same values.;1
The status for the Block and status for each SV with LNP Type of POOL within the 1K Block, may not always contain the same value.;1
The matriX to coordinate the status is found in the detailed requirements.;0
The failed SP List for the Block and Failed SP List for each SV with LNP Type of POOL within the 1K Block, may not always contain the same Service Providers.;1
The matriX to coordinate the various Failed SP Lists is found in the detailed requirements.;0
Once a Block is ?active?, the routing data can be modi?ed.;1
This may be performed by NPAC Personnel using the NPAC OpGUI, Service Provider Personnel using the NPAC Low-tech Interface, or Service Provider Via the SOA-to-NPAC SMS Interface.;0
At the time of NPA-NXX-X deletion (i.e., de-pool), the NPAC will check for ?pending-like, with Active POOL? SVs, or ?pending-like, port?to-original? SVs.;1
If any are found, the NPAC will reject the Deletion of this NPA-NXX-X.;1
An error message will be generated for the NPAC personnel.;0
The Pending-Like With Active POOL Subscription Version and Pending-Like Port?to-Original Subscription Version report will be available to NPAC personnel.;1
The report will contain TN, Old SPID, New SPID, Due Date, and Status.;0
Once they are cleaned up, NPAC personnel will await noti?cation from the Pooling Administrator prior to attempting the NPA-NXX-X deletion again.;0
The NPAC performs a ?cascading delete? when processing an NPA-NXX-X Deletion.;0
This includes sending deletes of Pooled SV data to non-EDR LSMSs, and sending deletes of Block data to EDR LSMSs.;0
Once all LSMSs have successfully deleted the Pooled data (the status of all SVs and the Block is Old, and both Failed SP Lists are empty), the NPA-NXX-X is deleted.;1
Similar to the NPA-NXX-X Creation, the NPA-NXX-X Deletion is broadcast to the appropriate Service Providers, based on the values in their NPA-NXX-X Indicators.;0
During the de-pooling process, the vacant number treatment responsibility and snapback for TN re- assignment noti?cations have unique behavior, once the Block has migrated to a status of Old.;1
As de?ned in #14 above, snapback messages will go to the Block Holder, and default routing will be the responsibility of the Code Holder, once the NPA-NXX-X?s Effective Date has been reached.;1
However, in this de-pooling situation, both snapback messages and default routing responsibility will be the Code Holder.;0
So, even though the NPA-NXX-X still eXists, it has the same behavior as the ?pre-effective date? NPA-NXX-X s1tuat10n.;0
Once the Block has been deleted in the NPAC, then NPAC processing considers the Block to be ?deleted? for the Block Holder, and all snapback messages and default routing will go to the Code Holder.;1
Additionally, the Block is now available to be allocated to another Service Provider.;0
37. convert the Block and SVs back to the Old NPA-NXX, if the New NPA-NXX is removed from the NPA Split, prior to the end of PDP.;0
When adding an NPA-NXX-X during an NPA Split, the NPAC will automatically add a corresponding New/Old NPA-NXX-X for an NPA-NXX involved in a Split.;1
During PDP, the NPAC will treat Block data similar to the treatment of SV data (i.e., either the Old or New NPA-NXX can be sent to the NPAC, but the NPAC will broadcast the New NPA-NXX).;1
The NPAC Customer LSMS EDR Indicator in the NPAC Customer Data Model will be added to indicate whether or not the Service Provider uses Ef?cient Data Representation on the Local SMS (TRUE : yes, FALSE : no).;1
The two new objects that will be broadcast over the interface include the NPA-NXX-X (1K Block) block allocation, and Block for EDR compatible Local SMSs that represent the 1000 TNs of POOL?ed numbers as the 1K Block.;1
The basis for the National Number Pooling requirements was the Illinois Number Pooling NPAC Release 1.4.;0
The Number Pooling Delta document, National Number Pooling requirements, represents the requirements for National Number Pooling functionality.;0
NOTE: for the last column (during Block de-pool), the behavior is the same as the pre-effective date column.;0
A block may still eXist in the NPAC SMS with a status of Old.;0
At the time of de-pooling, the Block goes back to the Pooling Administrator and is awaiting re-assignment to the next Block Holder.;1
The NPA-NXX-X may also eXist in the NPAC SMS until a Block is successfully deleted from all Local SMSs.;0
During that year, the task force made signi?cant progress in de?ning and resolving the issues related to implementing number portability.;0
All North American regions for deployment in all North American Local Number Portability Regions then used the work done by the Illinois task force to move forward with LNP implementation.;0
A group was formed under NANC called the LNPA Working Group that oversaw implementation issues and documentation clari?cations to the FRS and Us for Release 1.0.;0
Midwest Region Number Pooling To support number pooling in the Midwest Region requirements were developed and implemented.;0
The requirements are included in Appendix F for completeness.;0
If a service provider system is implementing Midwest Region Number Pooling then some of these requirements will supercede other requirements in this FRS document.;0

The initial investigation kept going with understanding what already exists and what the legal, organisational and semantic requirements are.;0
Based on that, a concept for the overall VCD was de?ned and elaborated.;0
This report documents the results of these activities as follows: The first chapter motivates the need for a comprehensive interoperable VCD solution.;0
It describes the status quo procedure of collecting evidences to prove selection and exclusion criteria in public tenders and details the objectives, bene?ts and success criteria of a pan-European interoperable VCD solution.;0
Apart from that, the risks, challenges and potential barriers of a VCD are outlined.;0
Chapter 2 describes the conceptual solution of the VCD, i.e.;0
the vision and scope of the Virtual Company Dossier as well as the four-stage approach developed to take into consideration different maturity levels for accessing evidences in different Member States.;0
To put the VCD concept as introduced in chapter 2 into the proper legal, organisational and semantic framework, chapter 3 details these aspects along the respective objectives, the approaches and the suggested ways forward.;0
Likewise, the specific requirements derived from detailed considerations are outlined.;0
The chapter also investigates the technical and infrastructure-specific framework including requirements for security, records management and metadata.;0
The alignment with activities of CEN and with the work package 8 (PEPPOL infrastructure) are argued within the technical framework, too.;0
Finally, related methodical frameworks such as ISO development standards are assessed in order to ensure high-sophisticated development quality for the subsequent VCD specification and implementation.;0
In chapter 4, high-Ievel concepts for pilot implementations are introduced.;0
This includes an initial outline for the pre-VCD mapping tool implementation, which is necessary for realising the pre-VCD mapping of stage 1 of the VCD vision (of.;0
Furthermore, concepts for solutions are detailed along a description of operating environments of the pilots.;0
According to the description of work, two pilots will be implemented to run interoperable solutions for economic operators to submit evidences to prove exclusion and selection criteria in public tenders according to directive 2004/18/EC.;0
Hence, the partners from Austria and Italy will introduce their plans for VCD pilot infrastructures and solutions.;0
In chapter 5, we detail major requirements for VCD interoperability and assess the vision and scenarios of the four-stage VCD concept along their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT).;0
We furthermore argue and outline the plans for the next steps, i.e.;0
the subsequent technical, legal and organisational speci?cation of the VCD.;0
Chapter 6 concludes the report at hand with some reflections and lessons learnt in respect of the analysis, challenges, constraints, results and potentials of the VCD specification and subsequent implementation.;0
The work in phase 1 of the VCD development formed the crucial basis for understanding and conceptualisation.;0
Hence, it is complemented with a glossary which forms the common terminology developed in the course of the Virtual Company Dossier analysis and requirements speci?cation phase.;0
Instruments of analysis are attached in the Annexes such as a questionnaire for contracting authorities, a questionnaire for legal analysis and a template for stakeholder analysis.;0
However, the current European pub|ic eProcurement infrastructure is inappropriate because it is characterized by a high market fragmentation and a lack of interoperability.;0
Hence, a major objective of the European Commission is to enable European-wide eProcurement across borders by creating common principles and technical solutions that are applied within all Member States.;0
Governments are the largest buyer in the European Union which purchase at a level of approximately 15-20% of GDP (Ministeria|_Dec|aration 2005).;0
Governments are lagging behind major industries in exchanging relevant data with key actors such as suppliers.;0
Common standards for electronic data exchange seem to be a key element for companies to participate in public eProcurement.;0
A European- wide eProcurement infrastructure could save governments up to 5% on expenditure and the transaction costs for both buyers and suppliers could be reduced by 50-80%.;0
A greater competition and efficiency in eProcurement will influence the whole economy and may also play an important role in achieving the Lisbon objectives, e.g.;0
to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge- based economy in the world (Commission_of_the_European_Communitites 2004).;0
By 2010 at least 50% of public procurement above the EU public procurement threshold will be carried out electronically.;0
"Over the period 2006-2010 Member States will focus their efforts on delivering those high impact services in Europe which will contribute most to the achievement of the Lisbon Agenda.""";0
However, current eProcurement infrastructures are inappropriate to reach this ambitious aim since these are characterized by a high market fragmentation.;0
Across Europe, eProcurement systems have already been developed with a focus on the automation of different eProcurement procedures.;0
Current systems reflect various country-specific public procurement needs and national laws, priorities, and practices.;0
Systems are either centrally oriented or designed to re?ect federated systems demands.;0
In addition, varying terminologies are used within the European Member States.;0
The lack of a unified eProcurement terminology is a major barrier which affects the possibility of a smooth collaboration between Member States and their eProcurement systems (Commission_of_the_European_Communitites 2004).;0
Legal, technical and organisational barriers prevent the development of a common Procurement infrastructure and are one of the greatest challenges to be solved by politics, governments, ICT industry and research (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004).;0
To facilitate EU-wide interoperability in public eProcurement, the European Commission co-funds the PEPPOL project in the ICT Policy Support Programme within the Competiveness and Innovation framework Programme (CIP).;0
PEPPOL1 aims at setting up pan-European pilot solutions that conjointly exist with national infrastructures.;0
1.1 Need for a Virtual Company Dossier A VCD will facilitate electronic Tendering by providing cross-border data and document solution that contains the necessary attestations and certificates typically required in eTendering.;0
Thus it can be seen as a container for documents.;0
Yet up to now, the tendering documents such as attestations and certificates required in public procurement procedures differ between Member States.;0
When a contracting authority publishes a contract notice, it shall include the selection, qualification and non- exclusion criteria.;0
The economic operators have to submit evidence and proof in respect of these criteria.;0
Hence, during the preparation of the tender an economic operator needs to collect the respective evidences (i.e.;0
certificates and qualification documents) from a number of issuing bodies (e.g.;0
The overall aims and expectations of a virtual company dossier solution as set out in the description of work can be described as follows: 1.;0
In order to create the VCD, an implemented IT system will have to collect certificates and attestations from existing registries.;0
It also enables the economic operator to add seIf-declarations or other documents of formal quali?cation.;0
Furthermore, the VCD solution supports economic operators in producing a VCD and in enabling them to submit the required documentation (assembled as an information package) to any contracting authority in Europe.;0
In the same way the VCD as an implemented IT system will enable contracting authorities or their eTendering systems to interpret and accept the documentation submitted by the economic operator.;0
Therefore the contracting authority must either specify the documentation that has to be submitted by economic operator or the criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion that have to be ful?lled by the economic operator.;0
"For all parties (economic operator, intermediary, contracting authority, issuing bodies) it will be of high importance that the VCD Service Providers are trustworthy; this implies that the services are precise, up-to-date, available and reliable.";0
The criteria must be consistent with directive 2004/18/EC (EC 30.04.2004): 0 Article 45 - Personal situation of the candidate or tenderer: e.g.;0
ISO certificates 0 Article 50 - environmental management standards 0 (Article 51 - Additional documentation and information) Criteria are listed in the Directive and can be established by the contracting authority within the contract notice.;0
A key aspect in the VCD development is to support a common set of criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion derived from the directive and their ful?lment through evidences.;0
Work package 2 will not implement a common set of attestations.;0
Thereby it must be taken into account that some countries do not issue such documents or certificates (e.g.;0
in Norway extracts from the judicial record may be produced in respect of economic operators, but not in respect of private persons, for the purpose of a tender procedure) and this hinders economic operators to evidence certain criteria.;0
In such cases, economic operators can only provide similar evidences that ful?l the same criteria.;0
So the link between individual evidences and the respective criteria they may approve for (as listed above) must be precisely indicated and mapped in order to support economic operators in their activity.;0
Article 52 indicates a potential solution which may be addressed in the VCD development too.;0
A|so tendering platforms can be used by the contracting authority (1).;0
"The steps of publishing the contract notice are part of ?eNotification""2.";0
An Economic Operator can use means such as the TED system, existing tendering platforms or official national gazettes to search for contract notices (2) and to retrieve the relevant information about active tenders (3).;0
"The on|ine TED system provides broad advertising and presence of ?contract notices"" within the TED database.";0
TED publications of contract notices usually contain the tender and contract documentation including detailed criteria, speci?cations and conditions.;0
Almost all the TED?s contract notices have a summary of the requirements in other languages set by the Contracting Authority.;0
The mandatory publication of contract notices in TED is a means to ensure transparency for public procurement throughout Europe and to enable a well functioning inner market.;0
For contract notices below threshold, TED can also complement existing national sources through widespread information across borders.;0
Sometimes, the information on a contract notice provided in TED is not complete.;0
Hence, the Economic Operator must directly get the authentic contract notice and exact conditions from the Contracting Authority in order to avoid a failure on interpreting the requirements for participation.;1
If an Economic Operator decides to participate in a public tender across border, the appropriate selection and exclusion criteria have to be evaluated.;1
This means that the Economic Operator has to match these criteria set out in the contract notice of another country with the evidences (attestations, statements and certificates) of his or her own country in order to prove compliance (4).;0
The attestations can be retrieved from the appropriate issuing bodies such as ceItifiers, source registers, banks, public authorities, etc.;0
in the country where the Economic Operator is established (5).;0
The step of retrieving proofs of suitability and non-exclusion and collecting documents for the receiving entities becomes a necessary task and may take place at different times.;0
"In some European Member State countries the ?self?declaration"" (a statement issued by the Economic Operator) is adopted to claim an initial suitability for applying and attending a tender.";0
In this case, Economic Operators may retrieve their proofs of suitability only at a later stage if necessary at all.;0
In most cases an official translation of the documents submitted by the Economic Operator is required (6).;0
Some European countries are also imposing the submission of legally attested documents.;0
In this case, accredited official translators, lawyers or notaries have to issue such |ega||y attested translations of evidences.;0
Finally, the translated documents are submitted to the contracting authority (7) which checks their compliance with the appropriate (legal) requirements (8).;0
Steps (7) and (8) are performed through separated incremental cycles according to the established practice in the country of execution.;0
In some countries, the initial submission covers only the application with its set of declarations (two- phased tendering).;0
At a later stage and under an explicit request there is the real submission of the requested documents.;0
To give a flavour of diverging procedures in regards to document handling (6) in WP 2 partner countries: European Member States such as France and Germany accept legally binding seIf-declarations.;0
In the case of a two-phased tendering (e.g.;0
when negotiating with the Economic Operators), the submission of the documents is performed in the first phase.;0
Each Economic Operator usually has to submit a full set of documents proving his suitability.;0
France follows a two step approach: the Economic Operator first sends his offer and the self- declarations (no bankruptcy, no conviction, compliance with employment obligations, etc.;0
"); the second sub-step concerns only the contractor and consists in sending social and fiscal attestations and, if necessary, the copy of the decision of the judicial procedure.";0
|ta|y adopts the ?DirectAccess? to documents and information records managed by public administrations.;0
This solution removes from the Economic Operator the duty and burden to get and submit these speci?c attestations.;0
Countries such as Norway may follow yet another approach by requesting a set of formal documents (i.e.;0
A major point of discussion is a sustainable and reliable |ong-term vision for exchanging attestations among Member States.;0
This requires a paradigm shift towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and certificates that are currently just barely available in electronic form.;0
The creation of uniform infrastructure in this heterogeneous domain will take some time as several different environments and stakeholders need to be involved, and change may not be enforceable to all of them.;0
The aim is to support basic interoperability and exchange of documents on the lower maturity levels and leading towards direct electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity levels.;0
Thereby each maturity level is built upon the lower ones thus allowing integration and step by step advancement.;0
In the following we will introduce the staged maturity model for the VCD as depicted in Figure 2.;0
eXCIUEiOn 80d Quaii?? exclusion docs criteria docs criteria Figure 2: Vision of VCD (staged maturity model) The stages express different levels of maturity with respect to interoperability.;0
A staged implementation approach is necessary in order to handle the complexity of the domain and to take into account the needs of the Member States.;0
Every Member State should develop a solution that meets the demands of basic interoperability.;1
Basic interoperability can thereby be defined as a state where organisational transparency of cross?border tendering requirements is established (stage 1- pre-VCD mapping tool).;0
The efforts and expenses to develop a solution that ensures basic interoperability ought to be manageable and affordable.;0
The VCD specification must be generically and semantically extensible in order to reach a sustainable and fully-?edged solution in the final stage.;1
An eTendering system and a contracting authority must be able to interpret a VCD package assembled by a VCD application regardless of the implementation stage of the VCD application and the eTendering system.;1
Figure 2 illustrates the staged maturity model of the VCD that has been designed to show the different stages of implementation and development.;0
In terms of construction and implementation, the VCD may be seen as a solution focusing on the European interoperability on the basis of European/national requirements and legislation.;0
It is therefore necessary to ensure national transparency by gathering national requirements on certi?cates and quali?cation documents.;0
The next step then is to de?ne the structure of a VCD by adding several types of (meta)data into it (e.g.;0
evidences, structural data of the evidences, translations etc.);0
and to build an application that is able to compile VCDs and enabling economic operators to submit this information electronically to contracting authorities (Stage 2).;1
Beside this, stage 3 will focus on additional services such as maintaining a VCD or composing a VCD from different economic operators in case of bidding consortia.;0
Stage 4 (VCD networked package) will then provide a sophisticated method for changing the overall process from push to pull.;1
A contracting authority will receive a VCD on the basis of stage 2 and 3 (push) but the documents itself will not be submitted anymore.;0
Instead a contracting authority can request those documents on demand from a database (pull) at national service provider who hosts VCD services, or directly from the very registration authority.;1
The VCD networked package will provide the basis for further developments towards an electronic exchange of evidence.;1
The stages follow a generic approach and may be seen as the evolution or development according to an underlying maturity model.;0
The model as presented in Figure 2 is further described in the following subsection with the purpose to detail the various stages.;0
3 Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.;0
0 VCD can provide direct access to attestation if there is a mandatory rule for it in law.;1
0 VCD systems provide single point of contact to attestations from public sources and information necessary to prove conformance to a given call for tender.;1
0 A VCD Package may be linked to exactly one call for tender thus it is tender speci?c 0 A VCD Package may contain self?declarations and several other documents provided by the economic operator.;1
The level that will be reached by a Member State and the path to go will depend upon the goals and decisions of each single Member State.;1
On the PeppolNVP2 strategy there is explicit interest to have parallel increments on both sides, assuming that the semantic enrichment of the VCD package requires a corresponding enriched supporting system.;1
This means, the higher the level of support, the higher the interoperability between the Member States (enabled by richer semantics of the information provided in the VCD Package).;0
Services can be human beings, organisations as well as lT-services.;1
On this level of support the VCD rule set is defined as a reference model which is manually or semi- automatically consulted by the economic operator and/or the contracting authority.;1
There are no VCD Services established which compile, validate or deliver VCD-Packages.;1
On this level of support, the VCD Service can deduce from the provided structural metadata, whether the VCD Package is complete or not and if its evidences are valid or outdated.;1
2.1.3.2 Level of Completeness A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested evidences (all that are necessary to prove all requested criteria) are contained in it.;1
The range of evidences varies from self?declarations to official attestations or certi?cates issued by public authorities (see Figure 7 for a categorization).;0
From a pragmatic point of view, it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of evidences in a first step and to complete the VCD Package later on.;1
"It is also reasonable to define a default package list that has to be provided in most public tenders by economic operators independently of particular criteria mentioned by the ?Call for Tender"".";1
From these considerations we can derive the following approach: 1.;0
Create a VCD package;1
Create a tender-speci?c VCD Package through interconnection of VCD and call for tender;0
needed to proof criteria according to Articles 47 - 50 in the Directive 2004/18/EC later on in order to create a complete VCD-Package.;0
2.1.4 Criteria for qualification and selection and non-exclusion The criteria for qualitative selection and non-exclusion as defined in the Directive 2004/18/EC are the common ground for building a cross border VCD service.;0
The ?gure below shows the relevant criteria as de?ned in Articles 45-50 as these are regarded the most common ground when mapping any national criteria to the European ones.;0
The personal situation of a candidate (Article 45) can be for example further described by: 0 Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard to absence of conviction (sec.;0
45 ?2 (a- b)) 0 Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard compliance with fiscal and social obligations (sec.;0
So there will be basic information and compilation support provided in a first step.;0
Names, contents and qualities of VCD vary between countries, and in many cases economic operators are using the options of Article 51 to add additional up-to-date information from public registries.;0
2.1.5 Steps on the path of development 0 National criteria and attestations: The ?rst step delivers information on all the national attestations as well as on where and how to get them.;0
0 European mapping, economic operator specific: The second step provides a mapping of national attestations which evidence criteria defined by Directive 2004/18/EC7, and with a particular focus on Articles 45 and 46.;0
This is a ?rst move towards cross-border interoperability.;0
0 Extended European criteria set and mapping: The third step completes the information support by adding all the other criteria in Articles 47 to 50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC on a high level and where possible on sub criteria/atomic criteria level.;1
At this step the economic operators are supported with all the necessary information for participating in cross border tenders.;1
The third step is a minimum requirement to meet for all Member States participating in the PEPPOL- VCD-project thus it can be defined as a common goal.;1
It is a precondition to guarantee cross border interoperability.;0
The mapping is necessary for a correct system specification and further development according to the overall maturity model enabling improvements with regard to level of support.;0
A Member State may reduce the level of completeness with regard to compilation and decision support with regard to their Pilot, but information support should be provided to all criteria at least on a high level.;1
Beyond the third step, every MS may decide which path to follow and which level to achieve.;1
The path of development provides an idea of how to structure the national VCD project.;0
One may decide to settle for the second level of support, but focus on the most commonly used attestations (a minimum for this level of support).;0
A MS may next decide to stay there (no move), or to complete his service (move to the right) or to keep the narrow focus and head for the highest level of support (move upwards) (cf.;1
Thereby the Status quo procedure of section 1.2 remains unchanged, except that a pre-VCD mapping exists which is implemented and provided through a European service provider8 (see Figure 5).;1
The mapping tool provides information to the economic operator on which national attestations of his or her country ful?ll the criteria set by the procuring agency in the respective country (steps 4, 5).;1
Likewise, the contracting authority can check evidences and authorizations provided by economic operators via the pre-VCD mapping tool (step 9).;1
Tenders Electronic (?l Daily (TED) To fulfill a first precondition for a VCD package as introduced in Stages 2 and beyond, the pre-VCD mapping tool is the proposed function and the process that allows for its execution.;1
It consists of a tool and of a data structure representing different contexts.;0
These contexts are linked to the national public procurement domains and a single European common domain.;0
For every domain we suppose to get a representation of a national index which provides an overview of national criteria demanded in public procurement, and how these are evidenced (i.e.;1
which attestations and/or statements provide what evidence).;0
This index also indicates structural data of evidence for example the issuer of the individual attestations or statements and the service it may activate for public or reserved access.;1
Figure 6 depicts the general taxonomy for the pre-VCD mapping concept, while Figure 7 shows a detailed taxonomy of the concept ?evidence?.;0
V\?th this taxonomy, it is possible to map the fact that evidences can either be provided by the candidate himself (e.g.;0
self?declaration, declaration on oath, solemn statement) or specific issuers as certified authorities and/or [authorized] third parties.;0
It implies the design and rolling out of a tool for supporting the basic interoperability between different legal conditions for providing evidence in public procurement procedures.;0
As stated in the introduction, it can be seen as a minimum requirement for all Member States participating in the PEPPOL VCD work package.;0
At this stage, a semantic model is introduced that supports guidance in applying the relevant community rules on mutual recognition of evidences (e.g.;1
diplomas, certificates or other evidences of formal quali?cations) in cross-border procurement procedures.;1
The semantic model especially requires and provides for: o a mapping between available national attestations and the selection and exclusion criteria set by the contracting authority through European criteria.;1
As European criteria are the same for all Member States, they act as the pivot element for the mapping.;0
0 The contracting authority can check through the same mapping mechanism whether the submitted attestations express ful?lment with the relevant criteria or requirements.;1
0 The contracting authority can activate a direct access to attestations that are exposed through open services, including the international cross-linking.;1
Table 1 provides an overview of the outcome, approach, bene?ts and necessary efforts or limitations of the pre-VCD mapping.;0
Table 1: Major outcomes of Stage 1 Definition of a strategy for common structures (2004/18/EC_AIt.;0
47-50) to retrieve the mapping because the contracting authority uses a formal speci?cation in an electronic format to define the relevant selection or exclusion criteria.;0
Hence, these data can further be processed electronically.;1
This reduces nasty data entries and errors.;0
the criteria in a formally speci?ed format.;0
Expansion of call for tender notices with the formal representation of selection and exclusion criteria.;0
pre-VCD mapping tool A contracting authority sends a notification on a Call for Tender to a Publication body that publishes the call.;1
The Call for Tender contains the de?nition of evidences and the specific criteria on qualitative selection and exclusion that are relevant to this particular call.;1
If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular Call for Tender he can directly retrieve relevant information about evidences and criteria by using the information published in the Call for Tender.;1
In cases below threshold or in the cases where the public notice is partial, the economic operator might send a direct request to the contracting authority in order to retrieve the required information.;1
Having the relevant criteria in place the economic operator will be enabled to get a mapping to the national attestations that refer to those criteria via the pre-VCD mapping tool.;1
The same process can be performed by the contracting authority in order to check whether the submitted attestations adequately ful?l certain criteria asked for.;1
Such formal representation has to be addressed along with the setting of the tool.;1

1.5 References This document builds on the following references: ' An introduction to CDN technologies [1]. ';0
The research problem for internetworking of CDNs [2] ' The architecture for CDN peering [3]. ';0
The performance models to demonstrate the effects of peering and to predict user perceived performance [4]. ';0
CDN peering models along With the challenges for implementation [5].;0
Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise.;1
It is formed by a set of autonomous CDNs, Which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure for cooperation in order to Virtualize multiple providers.;0
It is expected that an effective peering arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur.;0
Initiation: A CDN?s reach and scale is limited by its ability to handle peak load, cost of equipment, scalable infrastructure, and/or demand for the increased coverage of its infrastructure.;0
Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing With other CDN(s).;0
The triggering condition must consider the expected and unexpected load increases in the initiating CDN.;1
Negotiated relationship: The controlling interest of a CDN to interconnect With other CDNs leads to the creation of a negotiated relationship.;0
Negotiated relationships can also be established through means non- technical terms (financial statement) or technical terms (SLAs).;0
Thus, negotiated relationships must specify the interactions among entities including service administration, coordination and disband (or re-arrangement) of internetworked CDNs.;1
In the CDN peering architecture, the mediator instance obtains the resource and access information from the Service Registry (SR), Whilst SLAs and other policies from the Policy Repository (PR).;0
The mediator instance on the primary CDN?s behalf generates its service requirements based on the current circumstance and SLA requirements of its customer(s).;1
Resource discovery: Once the initiating CDN identi?es its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with.;0
The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers.;1
The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs.;1
If there are any preexisting peering arrangements (for a long term scenario) then these will be returned at this point.;1
Otherwise, it carries out short term negotiations with the Peering Agent (PA) identi?ed peering targets.;0
CDN peering protocols: The next step is to con?gure the ?CDN peering? protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly speci?ed through the negotiated relationships.;0
This step includes advertising the con?gurations (topology aspects, geographical proximity, capability, performance, etc.);0
On establishment of a peering arrangement, these protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer.;1
Hence, necessary functional policies are deployed and administered in an effective way.;0
Once a peering arrangement is established, all participating parties cooperate in the execution of common goal(s).;0
Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships.;0
If no CDN is interested in such peering, peering arrangement creation through re-negotiation is resumed by tuning the negotiated relationships with reconsidered service requirements.;0
Decrease cost of Web access, increase QoS through reduced latency, reduce server load, and bandwidth consumption (by a particular CDN server), thus improving the performance of content delivery.;0
The operations performed by the product components [3] assist to realize the above goals.;0
Component-wise maj or functions are noted below.;0
The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents are as follows, A Web server replicates content on-demand from the origin server and stores it for future use.;1
In the event of Web hotspot, it initiates request to trigger peering.;0
The Web services host ensures the delivery of content to end-users based on the negotiated policies with other CDNs.;1
The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted.;1
The Web servers? underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers.;1
The Mediator performs the following maj or functions, It generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships.;1
It passes the service requirements to the PA.;0
It works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs.;1
It helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details.;1
In the face of traf?c surges, it supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator.;1
When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources.;0
The Policy Repository is used to perform the following functions, It Virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including Pws, PM, and Ppeenng (i.e.;1
Web server-speci?c policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peerin g arrangement.;0
So?ware Requirements Specification for Page 6 Internetworking 0f CDNs through Peering ' It provides a set of rules to the mediator to administer, manage, and control access to the resources in a peering arrangement. ';1
It returns existing peering policies to the PA during the establishment of long-term peering arrangements.;1
A Peering Agent carries out the following major functions, ' It acts as a policy-driven resource discovery module for establishing negotiations. ';1
It exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs. ';1
It is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with PAs of other peers and to acquire resources from them.;0
These maj or architectural features of the CDN peering are brie?y described in the following: ' Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data.;0
Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute. ';1
mediator, PA and policy repository as a single conceptual entity) in a periodic or threshold- based manner.;1
The gateways of participating CDNs then communicate aggregated load information describing the load of their constituent servers. ';1
Request assignment and redirection is performed at multiple levels 7 at the DNS, at the gateways to local clusters, and also (redirection) between servers in a cluster.;1
Therefore, end- users can be assigned Via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also Via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate.;1
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics The users of the software infrastructure enabling CDN peering can be differentiated by using their membership and contributions to the system.;1
A given peering arrangement consists of explicit and implicit members.;0
Explicit members include the primary CDN, which is the initiator of a peering relationship, and any peering CDNs who cooperate for resource sharing.;1
Implicit members are content providers and end?users.;1
Implicit members are transparent to a peering arrangement but they share the bene?t from it.;1
In addition, users can vary based on the purpose, size, scope and duration of peering.;1
For instance, a short?term peering arrangement is to be automated to react within a tight time frame?as it is unlikely that a human directed negotiation would occur quickly enough to satisfy the evolved niche.;0
On the other hand, establishment of a long-term peering arrangement calls for a human-directed agent to ensure that any resulting decisions comply with participating CDNs? strategic goals.;0
Users can also be classi?ed because of the preferential treatment that they may receive due to the policy that pertains to a particular provider?s business logic.;1
Moreover, individual users (or a group of users) can have dynamic QoS requirements depending on the situations that will result in ?customized? content delivery.;1
Thus, users (or class of users) can be differentiated based on user- de?ned QoS speci?cations while accessing the service.;1
In this regard, existing Web services technologies will be studied in detail to examine the feasibility of leveraging them.;0
A modular implementation stack could be developed on top of the existing standard application layer (e.g.;0
A modular implementation approach would be useful to perform testing on modules at different stages to ensure correct implementation.;0
It is anticipated that a cryptographically secure auction-based framework will be used to assist content replication among peered CDNs to allow incentives for all participants.;1
Load information could be measured and disseminated within individual CDNs and among other CDNs using distributed load indices such as Distributed Hash Table (DHT) or variations of it.;1
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints The challenges in developing the product include Virtualization of multiple providers and of?oading end-user requests from the primary CDN provider to peers based on cost, performance and load.;0
Due to the proprietary nature of existing CDNs, limited information about response time or service cost is typically available from individual CDNs, and load balancing control is retained by an individual provider within its own Web servers.;0
Therefore, request-redirections must occur over distributed sets of Web servers belonging to multiple CDN providers, without the bene?t of the full information available, as in the single provider case.;1
Moreover, an implementation model for the product enabling CDN peering could be based on a complex combination of attributes such as Web server responsiveness or load, expected network delay, or geographic location.;1
Several of these potential attributes vary over time and there is no single repository for listing the value of attributes such as geographic location or expected delay for all Internet-connected systems.;1
It is anticipated that the values used in a CDN peering implementation model are likely to be based on heuristics.;1
2.6 User Documentation Along with the software product, a user manual would be written to help people understand the working methodology and usage of the developed prototype system.;0
It would be written for non- technical individuals and the level of content or terminology would differ considerably from, for example, a System Administration Guide, which is more detailed and complex.;0
2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies The product would build on leveraging existing systems.;0
In this regard, necessary inspirations could be obtained by analyzing related systems such as CoDeeN, Coral, Globule, and MotusNet.;0
In particular, the design and implementation approach of MotusNet could be helpful to draw a clear guideline for developing the intended prototype.;0

System Features The major services and functional requirements for the product can be illustrated by system features.;0
This section is organized by use cases for major system features.;0
In the following, necessary description is provided for each use cases in the system.;0
Each use case description provides information of the associated actors, triggering condition, preconditions, postconditions, response sequences, exceptions and functional requirements (assumptions).;0
Being a major important section of the SRS, this section is expected to go through iterative improvement to make the most logical sense for the intended product.;0
3.1 Service Registration This feature is associated with the registration of resource and service information of each CDN to its SR.;0
1.3 Preconditions Available local resources of a CDN provider are detected along with their service information such as CPU, storage, upload and download rate, etc.;1
These resources could be provisioned and reserved to satisfy SLAs.;0
3.1.4 Postconditions Resources are registered in the service registry and being updated in a regular basis.;1
So?ware Requirements Specification for Page 9 Internetworking 0f CDNs through Peering 3.1.5 Stimulus/Response Sequences 1.;0
Each CDN Web server publishes resource and service information.;1
If it is a new resource, its service information is registered in the SR with a new resource ID.;1
Resource ID counter is incremented.;1
Else, resource information in SR is updated in a regular basis.;1
In the face of traf?c surges, information on available local resources along with their IDs is supplied to the Mediator.;0
Local and delegated external resource information is encapsulated in the SR instance in the established peering arrangement.;1
REQ-3: Resource provisioning, delegation and reservation policies are in place.;1
3.2.2 Trigger It is invoked when a (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the workload on its WS(s).;1

Figure 4 shows use case for this feature.;0
Mediator Upon receiving the initialization request to trigger peering, the mediator generates service requirements and passes it to local PA. 3.3.3 Preconditions Initialization request is received.;1

So?ware Requirements Specification for Page 12 Internetworking 0f CDNs through Peering 2.;0
If any peering policies eXist, they are returned to establish long-term peering arrangement.;1
Else, short?term negotiation is performed.;1
Local PA in conjunction with the mediator interacts with external PAs through inter-PA communication protocol.;1
External resources are discovered and negotiation is performed with selected CDN peers.;1
If suf?cient resources are acquired, a peering arrangement is established 7.;1
Else, mediator re-evaluates service requirements and sends to the local PA to perform re-negotiation.;1
This feature is responsible for the inter-CDN protocol con?guration, resource initialization and for ensuring effective operations of the established peering arrangement.;0
The use case for this feature is shown in Figure 6.;1
External PA: Exchanges con?gurations and content availability information, and accepts requests to an optimal peer.;1
PR: Assists in enforcing negotiated policies.;1
3.5.2 Trigger Once policies are negotiated and a peering arrangement is established, PAs interact each other in the execution of common goal(s).;1
3.5.3 Preconditions A peering arrangement is established.;1
3.5.4 Postconditions Necessary functions policies are deployed and administration for effective operations.;1
3.5.5 Stimulus/Response Sequences 1.;0

3.6 Disband 0r Re-arrangement There could be circumstances under which a given peering arrangement may need to disband or re- arranges itself.;1
This feature is associated with the use case shown in Figure 7.;0
3.6.1 Actors External PA: Interactions with local PA of the primary CDN.;0

3.6.7 Functional Requirements REQ-l: Policies identifying the consequences of SLA Violation are de?ned.;1
REQ-2: Policies are in place to perform renegotiation for problem resolution.;1
REQ-3: Administrative policies are deployed for operations in a peering arrangement.;1
Details of the user interface design are intended to be documented in a separate user interface speci?cation.;0
4.2 Communications Interfaces As mentioned earlier, the intended product to eXploit existing Web service technologies to leverage existing infrastructures through building an overlay.;1
The communication among software component would be performed through message passing over the IP network.;1
From a technical point of View, TCP/IP will be used as the transport protocol, where each CDN server establishes a TCP connection to the network elements using a well-known port number.;1
Messages can then be sent bi-directionally between the server and network elements.;1
All messages consist of a ?xed length-header containing the total data length and a request followed by a reply or an acknowledgement.;1
Interaction among surrogates will be performed using HTTP or FTP.;1
Outbreak Management (OM) is the PHIN functional area intended to support the needs of investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of a health event or act of bioterrorism.;0
OM should aid in the collection and analysis of data to support identifying and containing the health event.;1
The application should also allow for new objects to be defined and created during the course of an investigation.;1
Central to the functionality of a system supporting OM is the ability to collect data related to cases and exposures and to create traceable links between all appropriate entities.;1
By tracing the mechanism of transmission and identifying the source of the health event, the appropriate response staff can more effectively contain the event.;0
This document provides minimum operational requirements necessary to support an outbreak management system and should in no way preclude a system from incorporating additional functionality beyond what has been covered in this document.;0
2.3 System Functions and Behaviors: Systems supporting OM should support case investigation, maintain detailed and comprehensive linkages, trace contacts, and quarantine and isolation monitoring activities.;1
2.4 Analysis, Visualization, and Report Generation: Systems supporting OM should enable investigators to produce both aggregated and individual reports about affected entities and events.;1
2.5 System Integration and Data Exchange: OM information must be exchangeable, based on established standards, between systems involved in the investigation, identification, confirmation, and reporting of a health event.;1
2.6 Vocabulary Standards: Standard vocabulary lists and data structures have been defined by standards organizations.;1
Where they exist, systems supporting OM should use them.;1
2.8 System Security and Availability: Security of OM data includes the protection of data from corruption and access by unauthorized individuals, as well as the protection of the actual systems supporting OM from sabotage or other failure.;1
A plan must be established for continuing activities when systems supporting OM are unavailable.;1
2.9 Privacy: Patients, organizations, and personnel must be protected from fraudulent and unauthorized use of their information.;1
2.1.2 Systems supporting OM must support structured data entry for common forms and fields to ensure data integrity, validity, and standardization.;1
A standardized data structure ensures that data mapping of common elements will only be necessary one time, rather than for each event.;1
2.1.3 Systems supporting OM should support multiple deployment options (e.g., client server, disconnected, and potentially web based).;1
2.1.3.1 Systems supporting OM should provide the ability for computers in disconnected mode to reconnect to a server to share OM data among other computers that operate in disconnected mode.;1

2.1.4 Systems supporting OM should be able to electronically record and store data from remote devices that may be uploaded to an aggregating system.;1
2.1.5 Systems supporting OM should be capable of using configurable, domain-specific vocabulary.;1
2.2 DATA REQUIREMENTS The following high-level data requirements are necessary to ensure that the data being collected, analyzed, and reported to support OM are clearly defined.;1
2.2.1 Entity Data An entity is any being or object involved in a health event.;1
Entities may be classified as a person, organization, location, animal, object, conveyance, event, or other organism.;1
Each type of entity requires specific data to be collected.;1
2.2.1.1.a Other descriptive details may be captured, such as occupation and work history.;1
A Subject ID should also be collected for animals in an OM investigation.;1
"It may be a challenge to ensure unambiguous identification because demographic details of an animal are not easily identified; therefore, animals involved in investigations may need to be tagged.";0
2.2.1.6 Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any conveyance involved in an OM investigation, including: type of conveyance, route taken (e.g., flight number), etc.;1
2.2.1.7 Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any public or private gathering of people (e.g., church social, ball game) involved in an OM investigation, including: time, location, nature of the event, etc.;1
2.2.1.8 Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any living things other than persons or animals that are involved in an OM investigation, including: type of living thing, and other customizable data collection questions.;1
2.2.1.9 Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture an entity?s travel history to support investigations of entities infected, exposed or potentially exposed.;1
2.2.2 Health Event Data 2.2.2.1 When a health event is investigated, it must be assigned an event identifier (i.e., Event ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction.;1
2.2.2.3 Systems supporting OM should have the ability to record the case definition for a health event.;1
2.2.2.4 Systems supporting OM should have the ability to capture changes to the case definition that occur as the health event evolves.;1
Examples of travel history include a person?s local travel as a part of their daily activities as well as the shipment of animals or plants from one country to another.;1
2.2.3.1.a Information about each leg of a trip, as well as the parent information about the trip, should be captured.;1
2.2.3.2 Travel history data to be collected for an animal or object should include shipping invoices, animal shelter delivery and adoption receipts, and delivery schedules (including delivery vehicle and driver information).;1
2.2.4 Case Investigation and Exposure Contact Data Case and exposure data provide more detailed information beyond demographic data.;1
Cases can be persons or animals, and exposure contacts can be persons, animals, other organisms, or exposure settings, such as travel conveyance, location, organization, object, or event.;1
2.2.4.1 Because attributes of both case and exposure data may describe the same entity, systems supporting OM must have the ability to avoid capturing redundant entity demographic information.;1
2.2.4.2.b There must be a means to update the case diagnosis either manually or automatically if the case definition changes during an event.;1
2.2.4.2.c Epidemiological (epi) data must be collected to assist in the case investigation of events.;1
Standard epi data to be collected includes: onset date and time of symptoms, type of symptoms, risk factors, medical history data, laboratory data, procedure data, and questionnaire responses.;1
2.2.4.2.d Systems supporting OM must allow for dynamic, event-specific case investigation data to be captured.;1
2.2.4.2.e In the context of a case, all entities exposed to a case must be recorded and linked to the case.;1
2.2.4.2.f Demographic information should be collected about the investigator, including their name, address, and contact information, so that the investigator may be contacted to answer questions or to provide additional information.;1
2.2.4.2.g Both the jurisdiction investigating the event and the jurisdiction reporting the cases and associated investigations must be captured.;1
For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence and investigated by the jurisdiction visited.;0
2.2.4.2.h Systems supporting OM should have the ability to classify entities associated with the investigation as investigation controls.;1
For example, controls share demographic characteristics with the subject of the case, but are not infected with the agent that is the focus of the investigation.;0
2.2.4.3.b Detailed data must be collected about the source of exposure as well as the exposed entity to support contact exposure tracing.;1
Exposure data related to both the potential source and the potential spread include the entity?s type, Subject ID, Contact ID, contact?s name and address, exposure dates and times, health status, and priority code.;1
2.2.4.3.c Epi data must be collected to assist in the exposure investigation of health events.;1
2.2.4.3.d Systems supporting OM must support capturing dynamic, event- specific data that describes contact between two subjects.;1

2.2.6.10.a If the specimen/sample collection record exists, the laboratory result must be linked to the specimen collection record by the Specimen ID.;1
2.2.6.10.b If the specimen/sample collection record does not exist, the laboratory result must be linked to the subject by the Subject ID.;1
2.2.6.10.c All levels of granularity of results (e.g., specimen/sample level, assay level) must be supported.;1
2.2.9.2 Activity logs, which are tools for investigators to track their actions during a case, should be supported.;1
For example, investigators may log calls made to monitor symptoms or calls made to schedule follow-up visits.;0
2.2.9.3 Activity logs may also provide information needed to support communication with various jurisdictions in the event that the investigation crosses jurisdictional boundaries.;1
For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence, rather than by the jurisdiction visited.;0
They will be designed by investigators to collect common data elements (e.g., patient demographics, test results, exposure contacts), agent-specific data elements (e.g., specific laboratory test), and other customized data elements.;1

2.3.2.2 Entity-to-epi data links must match the entity to their symptoms, survey questions, specimens/samples collected, laboratory results, and prophylaxis and treatment data.;1
2.3.2.3 Each new case must be able to link an assigned Entity ID to an Event ID within the scope of the investigation.;1
2.3.2.5 Laboratory results must be linked to corresponding specimens/samples including multiple results from one specimen/sample), and subjects when the participating laboratory returns the results.;1
These linkages must unambiguously associate multiple laboratory results to case and contact identifiers.;1
2.3.3.2 Contacts of exposed entities (e.g., people, animals, places) may be traced, investigated, and monitored.;1
2.3.3.3 Systems supporting OM should be able to create new contacts from existing case records, and should also identify the contact type.;1

Appendix A: Data Flow Diagrams of Diagnostic Processes for Chillers.;0
Cooling Towers and Chilled Water Distribution provides diagrams showing the data ?ows and data-processing that lead from fixed data and sensed data to diagnostic conclusions.;0
All specific requirements are numbered in later sections.;0
Product Perspective Currently, diagnostics on HVAC units and subsystems are performed largely on a manual basis.;1
Sensed data, e,g,, temperatures and pressures, are obtained from one or more data acquisition devices, These devices measure and store sensed data over periods of several days to several weeks.;0
Prior to the diagnostic process, data from these devices is input to graphical display software for Visual inspection by a human expert.;1
The expert, relying on technical expertise and results of previous diagnostic eXperience, evaluates the condition of the unit and subsystems based on Visual plots of the data.;1
This process is depicted in Figure 1, The process depicted in Figure 1 can be partitioned into three logical components.;0
These components are delineated in the diagram by dashed lines and are the data-preprocessing component, the diagnostic component, and output component.;0
The diagnostic tool described in this document will replace the current process with an automated one based on algorithms derived from expert practices.;1

Outbreak Management (OM) is the PHIN functional area intended to support the needs of investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of a health event or act of bioterrorism.;0
OM should aid in the collection and analysis of data to support identifying and containing the health event.;1
The application should also allow for new objects to be defined and created during the course of an investigation.;1
Central to the functionality of a system supporting OM is the ability to collect data related to cases and exposures and to create traceable links between all appropriate entities.;1
By tracing the mechanism of transmission and identifying the source of the health event, the appropriate response staff can more effectively contain the event.;0
This document provides minimum operational requirements necessary to support an outbreak management system and should in no way preclude a system from incorporating additional functionality beyond what has been covered in this document.;0
2.3 System Functions and Behaviors: Systems supporting OM should support case investigation, maintain detailed and comprehensive linkages, trace contacts, and quarantine and isolation monitoring activities.;1
2.4 Analysis, Visualization, and Report Generation: Systems supporting OM should enable investigators to produce both aggregated and individual reports about affected entities and events.;1
2.5 System Integration and Data Exchange: OM information must be exchangeable, based on established standards, between systems involved in the investigation, identification, confirmation, and reporting of a health event.;1
2.6 Vocabulary Standards: Standard vocabulary lists and data structures have been defined by standards organizations.;1
Where they exist, systems supporting OM should use them.;1
2.8 System Security and Availability: Security of OM data includes the protection of data from corruption and access by unauthorized individuals, as well as the protection of the actual systems supporting OM from sabotage or other failure.;1
A plan must be established for continuing activities when systems supporting OM are unavailable.;1
2.9 Privacy: Patients, organizations, and personnel must be protected from fraudulent and unauthorized use of their information.;1
2.1.2 Systems supporting OM must support structured data entry for common forms and fields to ensure data integrity, validity, and standardization.;1
A standardized data structure ensures that data mapping of common elements will only be necessary one time, rather than for each event.;1
2.1.3 Systems supporting OM should support multiple deployment options (e.g., client server, disconnected, and potentially web based).;1
2.1.3.1 Systems supporting OM should provide the ability for computers in disconnected mode to reconnect to a server to share OM data among other computers that operate in disconnected mode.;1
2.1.3.2 OM data should be synchronized so that all instances of OM applications working from the same server are able to share and use the same data.;1
2.1.4 Systems supporting OM should be able to electronically record and store data from remote devices that may be uploaded to an aggregating system.;1
2.1.5 Systems supporting OM should be capable of using configurable, domain-specific vocabulary.;1
2.2 DATA REQUIREMENTS The following high-level data requirements are necessary to ensure that the data being collected, analyzed, and reported to support OM are clearly defined.;1
2.2.1 Entity Data An entity is any being or object involved in a health event.;1
Entities may be classified as a person, organization, location, animal, object, conveyance, event, or other organism.;1
Each type of entity requires specific data to be collected.;1
2.2.1.1.a Other descriptive details may be captured, such as occupation and work history.;1
A Subject ID should also be collected for animals in an OM investigation.;1
"It may be a challenge to ensure unambiguous identification because demographic details of an animal are not easily identified; therefore, animals involved in investigations may need to be tagged.";0
2.2.1.6 Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any conveyance involved in an OM investigation, including: type of conveyance, route taken (e.g., flight number), etc.;1
2.2.1.7 Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any public or private gathering of people (e.g., church social, ball game) involved in an OM investigation, including: time, location, nature of the event, etc.;1
2.2.1.8 Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any living things other than persons or animals that are involved in an OM investigation, including: type of living thing, and other customizable data collection questions.;1
2.2.1.9 Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture an entity?s travel history to support investigations of entities infected, exposed or potentially exposed.;1
2.2.2 Health Event Data 2.2.2.1 When a health event is investigated, it must be assigned an event identifier (i.e., Event ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction.;1
2.2.2.2 Data describing the health event should be captured, including the reason for the investigation, the category of event (e.g.;1
environmental, infectious), the date the event began, the suspected agent (if known) or investigation focus, the geographic area impacted by the event, as well as the event status (e.g., open, closed).;1
2.2.2.3 Systems supporting OM should have the ability to record the case definition for a health event.;1
2.2.2.4 Systems supporting OM should have the ability to capture changes to the case definition that occur as the health event evolves.;1
Examples of travel history include a person?s local travel as a part of their daily activities as well as the shipment of animals or plants from one country to another.;1
For example, if a person who lives in Georgia travels to Seattle and becomes exposed to monkey pox, then visits a friend in Santa Fe, travel history and conveyance data should be noted accordingly for each place the exposed person traveled.;0
2.2.3.2 Travel history data to be collected for an animal or object should include shipping invoices, animal shelter delivery and adoption receipts, and delivery schedules (including delivery vehicle and driver information).;1
2.2.4 Case Investigation and Exposure Contact Data Case and exposure data provide more detailed information beyond demographic data.;1
Cases can be persons or animals, and exposure contacts can be persons, animals, other organisms, or exposure settings, such as travel conveyance, location, organization, object, or event.;1
2.2.4.1 Because attributes of both case and exposure data may describe the same entity, systems supporting OM must have the ability to avoid capturing redundant entity demographic information.;1
2.2.4.2.b There must be a means to update the case diagnosis either manually or automatically if the case definition changes during an event.;1
2.2.4.2.c Epidemiological (epi) data must be collected to assist in the case investigation of events.;1
2.2.4.2.d Systems supporting OM must allow for dynamic, event-specific case investigation data to be captured.;1
2.2.4.2.e In the context of a case, all entities exposed to a case must be recorded and linked to the case.;1
2.2.4.2.f Demographic information should be collected about the investigator, including their name, address, and contact information, so that the investigator may be contacted to answer questions or to provide additional information.;1
2.2.4.2.g Both the jurisdiction investigating the event and the jurisdiction reporting the cases and associated investigations must be captured.;1
For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence and investigated by the jurisdiction visited.;1
2.2.4.2.h Systems supporting OM should have the ability to classify entities associated with the investigation as investigation controls.;1
For example, controls share demographic characteristics with the subject of the case, but are not infected with the agent that is the focus of the investigation.;0
2.2.4.3.b Detailed data must be collected about the source of exposure as well as the exposed entity to support contact exposure tracing.;1
Exposure data related to both the potential source and the potential spread include the entity?s type, Subject ID, Contact ID, contact?s name and address, exposure dates and times, health status, and priority code.;1
2.2.4.3.c Epi data must be collected to assist in the exposure investigation of health events.;1
2.2.4.3.d Systems supporting OM must support capturing dynamic, event- specific data that describes contact between two subjects.;1
2.2.5 Monitoring and Follow-up Data Monitoring and follow-up data is used to track the progress and treatment of subjects who were exposed or potentially exposed to a health event.;1
For more information about monitoring and follow-up data, please reference ?PHIN Countermeasure/Response Administration Functional Requirements and Process Flows?, available at www.cdc.gov/phin.;0
2.2.5.1 Systems supporting OM should support the monitoring and follow-up activities required when tracking the status of cases and exposed individuals.;1
2.2.5.1.a Monitoring data should be collected about cases and exposed individuals who are isolated or quarantined because of a health event.;1
2.2.5.1.b Follow-up data should be collected from subjects or their proxies to track symptoms and compliance with recommended treatment plans or prophylaxis.;1
2.2.5.1.c Follow-up data may be received from take response exams of persons who received a countermeasure that requires such an exam (i.e., smallpox vaccination).;1
These specimens/samples can be collected from places, persons, animals, or environmental sources such as air, water, food, or soil.;1
2.2.6.1 Specimens/samples collected for laboratory testing must be assigned an identifier (i.e., Specimen ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction.;1
2.2.6.2 The subject of a specimen/sample collected for laboratory testing must be linked to the specimen/sample by an identifier (i.e., Subject ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction.;1
2.2.6.3 Systems supporting OM must be able to store data about the specimens/samples that are collected for laboratory testing.;1
2.2.6.3.a Clinical specimen data should include information about the specimen source/site from which the specimen was taken, symptom date of onset, and whether the sample is acute or convalescent.;1
2.2.6.3.c Food sample data should include information about the lot number, batch number, manufacturer name, shipping invoice, temperature, sample type (e.g., dairy ? milk, red meat, spice), and product storage condition.;1
2.2.6.3.d Bar-coding should be supported for the capture of detailed specimen/sample data to improve the quality and efficiency of data collection.;1
2.2.6.4 Chain of custody information for all specimens/samples should be captured.;1
2.2.6.6 Systems supporting OM must be able to create a laboratory test request for a specimen/sample or group of specimens/samples.;1
More information about creating laboratory test requests is found in section 2.5 System Integration and Data Exchange of this document.;0
2.2.6.9 Systems supporting OM must be able to store laboratory result(s) and link the result(s) to the original laboratory test request.;1
2.2.6.10 Systems supporting OM must store data about laboratory results.;1
2.2.6.10.b If the specimen/sample collection record does not exist, the laboratory result must be linked to the subject by the Subject ID.;1
2.2.6.10.c All levels of granularity of results (e.g., specimen/sample level, assay level) must be supported.;1
2.2.7.2 Contraindication information should be collected to indicate why vaccinations, treatments, or antidotes may not have been administered or why the patient may not have complied with prescribed interventions.;1
For specific data requirements regarding adverse event data, please reference PHIN Preparedness Countermeasure/Response Administration Functional Requirements and Process Flows, available at www.cdc.gov/phin.;0
2.2.9.2 Activity logs, which are tools for investigators to track their actions during a case, should be supported.;1
For example, investigators may log calls made to monitor symptoms or calls made to schedule follow-up visits.;0
2.2.9.3 Activity logs may also provide information needed to support communication with various jurisdictions in the event that the investigation crosses jurisdictional boundaries.;1
For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence, rather than by the jurisdiction visited.;0
They will be designed by investigators to collect common data elements (e.g., patient demographics, test results, exposure contacts), agent-specific data elements (e.g., specific laboratory test), and other customized data elements.;1
2.3.1.1.a Electronic questionnaires should provide the capability to accept digital signatures.;1
2.3.1.2 Systems supporting OM must provide the ability to control the configuration of and revisions to investigation-specific questionnaires.;1

2.3.1.5 Systems supporting OM should provide a manual or automatic means of updating the status of case records as the case definition changes.;1
2.3.1.6 Systems supporting OM should track the changes made to the status of case records as a result of changes in the case definition.;1
2.3.2 Linking Linkages allow investigators to create meaningful analysis, characterize the event, and identify at-risk populations.;1
2.3.2.1 Systems supporting OM must support dynamically defined associations between entities for the purpose of defining relationships.;1
For example, person-to-person (e.g., family relationship, exposure relationship), person-to- place (e.g., household, common place), animal-to-person, object-to-place, person-to-travel.;0
2.3.2.2 Entity-to-epi data links must match the entity to their symptoms, survey questions, specimens/samples collected, laboratory results, and prophylaxis and treatment data.;1
2.3.2.3 Each new case must be able to link an assigned Entity ID to an Event ID within the scope of the investigation.;1
2.3.2.5 Laboratory results must be linked to corresponding specimens/samples including multiple results from one specimen/sample), and subjects when the participating laboratory returns the results.;1
These linkages must unambiguously associate multiple laboratory results to case and contact identifiers.;1
2.3.3.2 Contacts of exposed entities (e.g., people, animals, places) may be traced, investigated, and monitored.;1
2.3.3.3 Systems supporting OM should be able to create new contacts from existing case records, and should also identify the contact type.;1
2.3.3.4 Systems supporting OM must support contact exposure tracing by allowing one contact to be linked to multiple cases, and allowing multiple contacts to be linked to a single case.;1
2.3.3.5 Systems supporting OM should be able to produce contact work lists for each investigator to use, and should allow sorting by priority or geography.;1
2.4.5 Systems supporting OM should have the ability to produce pre-formatted queries and reports to allow faster and more accurate reporting, while still allowing the flexibility of ad-hoc reporting.;1
2.4.6 Systems supporting OM should have the ability to produce individual reports for each emergency team member or investigator.;1
2.4.7 Systems supporting OM should have the ability to compare characteristics of exposed and non-exposed (i.e., controls) persons.;1
2.4.8 Systems supporting OM should have the ability to produce lists of action items (e.g., to do lists).;1
2.4.9 Systems supporting OM must have the ability to print questionnaires for multiple uses, including taking to the field, use during phone interviews, etc.;1
2.4.10 Systems supporting OM must be able to aggregate data.;1
Examples of aggregated data to be supported are: number of cases, number of contacts per case, and number of vaccinations and/or treatments administered.;0
2.4.11 Health event data should be aggregated into a centralized data store (i.e., data warehouse) designed specifically to support analysis of events over time.;1
Bi-directional, secure exchange of data with partner organizations supports public health investigations across all levels of public health.;1
2.5.1 Contact information for key response partner organizations should be stored in a local instance of a public health directory for associating to a health event, as described in section 2.2.2 Health event Data of this document.;1
2.5.2 Systems supporting OM must be able to accept data from other partner systems supporting OM.;1

2.5.16 Data exchange should support analysis and information sharing of possible health events at all levels of public health (e.g., national, state, local).;1
"2.6 VOCABULARY STANDARDS It is recommended that standards be used across systems supporting OM; however, it is required that vocabulary standards be used when exchanging data.";1
Vocabulary requirements that span PHIN functional areas should be reviewed in ?PHIN Preparedness Cross Functional Components Requirements?, available at www.cdc.gov/phin.;1

The system must allow web feeds to be turned on or off on a per-page basis. Search 3.4.1;1
This is a functional description of those features required to address current instructional and educational requirements.;0
Each requirement is accompanies by a short discussion, designed to add the background and framework necessary to explain the functionality.;0
It also describes nonfunctional requirements and other factors necessary to provide a complete and comprehensive description of the requirements for the softwa re. 1.2 Scope;0
This documents deals with the immediate requirements for the development of core functionality currently unavailable in Moodle, the existing courseware system candidate (version TODO: Version of Moodle).;0
The University?s enhancements to Moodle wi|| embody several small redesigns for consistency with other university practices.;0
Additionally, the enhancements will take the opportunity to redesign the user interface to reflect a more natural flow of data.;0
1.4.1 Moodle Requirements Brainstorming.pdf This document was generated as a foundation for this document and contains the results of stakeholder interviews.;0
This document does not make any further reference to the Confidential ? Ed Altorfer, Walker Lindley, Chris Page 6 Haller, Stefan Moluf, 2007;0
This document also forms the basis for continuing discussions with stakeholders and sponsors, to enhance and further describe those requirements to be included in future enhancements to Moodle.;0
We are making an assumption that Moodle is of interest to the University as a viable choice to replace Blackboard.;0
The goal of this document, and our work, however, is to determine what any courseware system would need to qualify as a viable solution for the University.;0
We also intend to apply this document to Moodle to determine whether we can implement some of the features that Moodle lacks and our stakeholders find to be important.;0
Our stakeholder feedback was gathered to help us determine the requirements of a replacement courseware system and provide analysis of the feature set in other available solutions.;0
User Characteristics Students Students are the primary consumers of a courseware system.;0
They are accessing information posted by professors, uploading assignments and project files, and discussing concepts. Professors Professors are the primary content administrators of a courseware system.;0
They contribute minimally to the courses themselves, but spend more time modifying the system?s configuration and making appropriate updates. 2.4 Stakeholder Needs;0
In order to determine what enhancements needed to be made to Moodle, we interviewed system stakeholders (e.g., professors and students) to determine what, if anything, is lacking in our existing courseware solution.;0
Our requirements and supplementary requirements are based on that feedback which is summarized in Moodle Requirements Brainstorming.pdf(referenced in section 1.4.1). 3.;0
Specific Requirements The priorities defined below reflect the requirements of the development team.;0
The system must be able to capture and manage files where appropriate.;1
One of the fundamental tasks of the system is to allow actors to upload and manage files on certain pages of the system.;1
These might include assignment submission pages, forum pages, wiki pages, and announcement pages.;1
Actors in the capacity of course administrator or professor should be able to enable multiple file uploads on a page of his or her choosing.;1
For collaborative projects, it becomes important for actors to be able to upload more than one file to a given page, especially in the case of an assignment submission where the assignment might include multiple parts.;1
Such a construct should be offered to the actor during a page?s creation and editing stages.;1
The system must be able to capture and organize voice clips that can be used where appropriate.;1
Actors in the role of professor or system administrator should be allowed to partition this space for actors in the roles of students.;1
This can be done one of two ways: 1) the actor can be allowed to preview the voice clip before it is archived and determine whether or not he or she would like that clip to be archived, or 2) a newly created voice clip can be automatically archived.;1
The first option would allow the actor to throw out an audio clip that is deemed to be unsuitable or inappropriate for an assignment without having to take it out of an archive of voice clips.;1
The actor should have the option to have the voice clip be archived after a preview has taken place.;1
The second option would automatically archive a voice clip once submitted but would require that the actor interact with the archived file.;1
Thus, if the actor chooses to delete the file, it would need to be deleted from the archive of voice clips.;1
Maintaining an archive of voice clips makes it possible for comparisons to be made between clips to determine whether an actor is improving his or her language skills over multiple courses.;1
The actor should be able to optionally attach one of his or her archived items to any page where uploads are permitted.;1
The term archive used above may also be referred to as a portfolio.;1
The system must allow actors to download their voice clips in a flexibleformat.;1
Voice clips should be optionally downloadable in a format such as MPEG Audio (mp3) format, since it is widely supported across different web browsers and operating systems.;1
Voice clips should be downloadable for archival purposes orfor the purpose of presenting them to other actors.;1
The system must store audio clips in a format conducive to speech.;1
Voice clips should be stored in a format optimized for speech since this feature is meant to catalog voice recordings.;1
This allows him or her to manage archived voice clips and to create a cohesive portfolio that actors in the role of professor can use tojudge improvement over time. 3.3 Web Feeds;1
Actors in the role of course administrators should have the ability to determine which of these components have feeds and to whom these feeds should pertain.;1
If actors are unable to be notified in some way of new content in Moodle, they are unable to efficiently keep track of a course?s current affairs.;1
For this requirement, page refers to any distinct block (e.g., assignments, wikis, forum threads, etc.).;1
The system must be able to use search functionality as a way to navigate Moodle pages instead of using hierarchical links. Moodle can be difficult to navigate and requires too many clicks to be efficiently used.;1
Too many steps to complete basic actions?such as submitting an assignment?lead to frustration on the part of the actor.;1
A search utility enables actors to find what they are looking for quickly in addition to having a hierarchical approach to finding functions of the course management system.;1
For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page, such as an assignment, a wiki page, or a forum post.;1
An actor must be able to search through pages in a course. Actors should be able to search for pages at the course level, since most actors will be searching for material in a given course.;1
The search feature should be present in two ways.;1
Confidential ? Ed Altorfer, Walker Lindley, Chris Page 10 First, it should be present in the form of a search box and a ?Search? button on the top or bottom of every page.;1
In addition to the basic search field, this page should allow an actor to filter out certain results (such as forum posts or grades, etc.) and search specific sections (or components) of the course management system.;1
Results should appear in categories (e.g., Assignments, Wiki Pages, Forum Posts, etc.) based on relevance.;1
In this case, relevance is determined by results that having the highest number terms matching the search terms.;1
When the actor clicks a search result link, they should be taken to the page corresponding to the search result.;1
In addition, the search page described above might allow for the possibility of searching the world wide web using a standard search engine such as Google.;1
The system must display a search box on every page after an actor has logged in. Actors should be able to search from any page.;1
If the actor is hierarchically outside of a particular course, each of his or her courses should be searched and results should be grouped by course.;1
Ifthe actor is hierarchically inside of a course, that course should be searched with an option to search all courses.;1
The system must allow actors in the capacity of course administrator to post grades associated with assignments for a particular actor in the capacity of student.;1
Actors in the role of professor may want to optionally grade assignments online since they are being submitted electronically by actors in the role of student.;1
Priority: 1 A course administrator must be able to grade on assignment. Course administrators should be able to post grades for an assignment based on the ratio of points earned to points possible.;1
The course administrator should also be able to attach feedback in the form of text or an attachment (as described above).;1
Time stamps should be attached to the last time the grade was modified so that actors may examine when particular grades were submitted and how an actor in the role of student has improved or lessened his performance in the course.;1
The system should display grade information to the appropriate actor. The system should display grade information such as the grade for each assignment, averages, and overall grade to the actor to whom the grades belong.;1
No other actor should be able to view another?s grades except an actor in the role of course administrator for the course to which the grades belong.;1
The system should maintain a grade history. The system should maintain a history of grades for a particular assignment if the course administrator changes them.;1
Course administrators can also track how they have changed a score over time using the timestamps associated with each change to the gradebook. 3.6 Social Networking Applications;1
The social, collaborative components of Moodle are not very robust.;0
There are better, freely- available solutions which should be integrated into Moodle to provide the best functionality possible for all actors without having to use 3rd party services.;0
A freely available wiki should provide a simple markup language that actors can use to style their input, as well as link to other pages in the wiki.;1
More importantly, having the wiki inside Moodle reduces confusion and allows for the integration of notifications and logins. 3.6.2;1
The system must provide a blog engine.;1
A freely available blog engine should provide all modern blog functionality, such as tagging, drafting, and comments.;1
These blogs should share authentication and notification with Moodle. 3.7 Notifications;1
Currently, there is no system that allows actors to receive SMS or email notifications of changes to Moodle pages (such as assignments or announcements). Priority: 3 3.7.1;0
The system must provide both e-mail and SMS notifications for pages. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum post, etc.).;1
When a page is created, the actor in the role of course administrator should be able to toggle whether notifications are turned on.;1
By default, they should be turned on for announcements.;1
They should also be able to manage their notification subscriptions (for example, remove themselves from notifications). 4.;1
General System Functional Requirements 4.1 Usability 4.1.1;0
As far as possible, the system should provide a simple, responsive interface.;1
Although any courseware solution may be composed of diverse systems, applications, and processes, the underlying architecture should be transparent to the administrators.;1
Furthermore, this interface must allow administrators to easily change themes and other setting that affect page layout across the entire courseware system. Priority: 3 Reliability;1
The system must be backed up on a configurable schedule. Back-up requirements will need to be determined, based on individual components of the system.;1
The system should be backed up with a frequency that ensures system and course data is protected.;1
Since assignments will be submitted via the system, it should be backed up on a nightly basis, with options for weekly, off-site backup when necessary.;1
Priority: 2 The system should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.;0
This statement provides a general sense of system availability.;1
It is not intended to demand the system maintain reliability, or to require the system to be highly available.;1
It should not exclude maintenance windows, or scheduled downtime.;1
It is only intended to convey the expectation that our customers should have access to the system during off-hours as well as business hours. 99% up-time should be considered sufficient to meet this requirement.;1
The system should support at least 1000 concurrent users.;1
This statement provides a general sense of reliability when the system is under load.;1
It is important that a substantial number of actors be able to access the system at the same time, since a courseware system is important to the courses that employ it.;1
The times when the system will be under the most stress are likely during midterm and finals weeks.;1
Therefore, it must be able to handle at least 1,000 concurrent users.;1
The system must be maintainable without substantial modification. Due to limited staff in the Office of Information Services, it is important that the system be mostly self?sustaining.;1
This will reduce the number of FTE hours spent maintaining the system and simplify maintenance tasks.;1
Users must have easy access to help while interacting with the system.;1
Adequate user documentation should be provided to minimize the number of calls to the Help Desk about problems with the system.;1
Modifications should be reported via the main page to inform actors of unexpected changes.;1
A comprehensive database of maintenance tasks and help files should be compiled to make the courseware system easier to maintain from an IT staff point-of?view.;1
Search results should be displayed based on relevance.;1
This documentation must cover all procedures necessary for regular maintenance with links to additional information, all common errors, and links or documentation for advanced troubleshooting.;1

References The reference documents below were used to prepare this requirements document: 1.5.;0
Overview The remainder of this document is divided into two sections.;0
Section 2 gives a high-level, user- and operationally-oriented view of the software.;0
Section 3 provides the detailed requirements including explicitly stated and derived functional requirements from which the RLCS Application will be designed.;0
Overall description This section describes the general factors that affect the RLCS Application software requirements.;0
This section does not state specific requirements, instead it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3.;0
The RLCS Application will allow an operator to view system status and issue commands to change device status as well as configure the system and generate reports.;1
The five major functions of the RLCS application software are a Graphical User Interface (GUI), Process Control and Monitoring, Sequencing, Data Processing and Security, and Reporting.;0
Product perspective This section describes how the RLCS Application software relates to other systems and software as well as how it functions internally.;0
User Interface The user will operate the RLCS Application software using a graphical user interface.;1
Hardware Interfaces RLCS application will seamlessly interface and control hardware devices.;1
Communications Interfaces The RLCS will provide access to system status data, to external systems through a firewall.;1
This will be a one way data transfer to a computer outside of the RLCS network and making it available there for public use.;1
The transfer will occur every 30 seconds.;1
A one way serial data transfer will also be provided.;1
RLCS workstations and controllers will reside on a private network to communicate field device information.;1
The RLCS private network communication media will include fiber, Cat 5 wiring Leased lines and dial-up lines Communications from the TMC to the DCU controllers is through the FCU controller.;1
In addition, wireless connections between the FCU and DCU controllers are not an option due to security and interference considerations 2.1.6.;1
Memory constraints The only memory constraints imposed on the software will depend on constraints associated with the intelligent controller selected for the system.;1
Site Adaptation The RLCS Application will operate as a component of the RLCS System, for which physical adaptations are described in ?Section 3.7 Physical? of the System Requirements Specification 2.2.;1
Product functions The data flow diagram below shows the five major functions of the RCLCS Application : GUI, Process Control and Monitoring, Sequencing, Data Processing and Security, and Reporting.;0
Traffic Operations Program Mgmt.;0
RLCS Operations & Maint.;0
Dashed lines indicate control flows.;0
User characteristics Several classes of users will access the RLCS Application.;1
A user is defined as anyone who has the ability to ?log on? to the RLCS.;1
External entities such as ATMS and ValuePricing, which will retrieve data from a server external to the RLCS network, are not considered users.;1
Also, the driving public will have access to system status via the changeable message signs, and eventually the Traveler Information Network, but are also not considered users of the system.;1
User Class Operator Management Field Maintenance Staff Electrical Systems (Hardware) Software Systems (Software) System Administrator Functions Command control of the system during normal mode.;1
Only one ?operator? may be logged onto the system at any given time.;1
Authorized to change system mode.;0
Reporting and status checking capabilities only Command control of the system only during maintenance mode.;1
Ability to execute maintenance mode control sequences from FCU workstations or remote dial-in terminals, as well as from the maintenance building workstation, but not from the TMC workstation.;1
Not able to change system mode.;1
Reporting and status checking.;0
Reporting and status checking.;0
A member of the District 11 technical staff (usually a Software Systems staff member) authorized to create and modify system configuration data, including staff, devices, and scheduled operations.;1
Authorized to changed system mode.;0
Security setup capabilities are defined in more detail in Section 3.;0
Constraints The following constraints were factors in the development of the detailed requirements for the.;0
RLCS Application: a) Regulatory policies ? There were no technical regulatory policies specifically covering the RLCS Application.;0
b) Hardware limitations ? The RLCS Application will reside on a hardware platform compatible with Microsoft Windows NT or Unix-based operating systems.;0
c) Interfaces to other applications ? Other than system level interfaces, such as network, operating system, and database system, there will be no interfaces to other applications.;0
e) Audit functions ? The RLCS Application will create and store log files which will track all I-15 RLCS Software Requirements Specification application activity.;1
f) Higher-order language requirements ? There are no specific high level language requirements, other than that a high level language be used to develop and maintain the RLCS Application for more cost-effective maintenance efforts.;0
g) Reliability requirements ? The RLCS Application must be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.;0
h) Criticality of the application ? The RLCS Application is important to the traffic management goals of the Southern California region.;0
Opening the lanes in the direction of the peak traffic flow to route traffic onto the reversible lanes is a critical operation in meeting these goals.;0
i) Safety and security considerations ? The safety of field maintenance staff and the traveling public is dependent on the correct functioning of the RLCS Application to open and close the facility.;0
"Should this type of event actually occur, it would be nothing less than catastrophic; for the motorists involved; for the traveling public in general, for the system operators, and for the Agency.";0
Another potential control system risk, lies with the barrier gates used at Locations 1, 2, and 5.;0
Should one of these gates be lowered across an otherwise open entrance, the results could be catastrophic.;0
There are less serious, but possibly more common control system risks in closure device/sensor failures during the opening or closing of an entrance.;0
In the absence of full system overrides, if the system allows, or causes, an entrance to be opened in one direction, when an entrance in the opposite direction is open, then the system has failed.;0
A well designed, carefully implemented, and thoroughly tested control system, can reduce the chance of such an occurrence (due to operator error, control system or sensor failure).;0
In order to achieve this, the nature of the risk must be understood and continually kept in mind by control system developers and testers.;0
Assumptions and dependencies The RLCS will benefit from the deployment of the Fiber Optic Network along I-15 Reversible Lane corridor to include the RLCS lanes.;0
The communications between the FCU and DCU locations will continue to be copper.;0
The primary mode of communication is fiber and secondary is ISDN.;0
The fail over will be transparent to the RLCS application.;0
A dialup connection will be used for remote access to the RLCS.;0
Apportioning of the requirements The RLCS software will not be apportioned, or split between multiple releases.;0
The complete set of requirements will be included in one release.;0
Specific Requirements This section of the SRS contains the RLCS Application software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design the system, and acceptance testers to test that the system satisfies the requirements.;0
This will be done before high-level software design phase.;0
Every stated requirement is externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems.;1
This section describes each input into the software, every output from the software, and all functions performed by the software.;0
Hardware Interfaces Multiple field devices will interface with updated device input/output cards that in turn will interface with an intelligent controller.;1
It is unknown at this time which particular controller will be used to control the field devices, but the software must interface with whichever controller is chosen to interface with the field devices.;1
The field devices and controllers in the table on the following page are currently in use at the facility.;0
See Appendix D for a table of current FCU-DCU and FCU-CMS interface pin configurations.;0
3.1.1.1 Field Device I/O Drivers The RLCS software shall send to and receive data from the field device I/O cards through I/O driver software.;1
The tables below show the description and locations of the field devices currently installed and to be installed at the facility.;1
Appendix D contains a chart with I/O card pin configurations.;0
*The controllers at the FCU and DCU will be replaced with modern controllers such as the Department of Transportation 2070 Advanced Transportation Controller (ATC) or a controller with equal or better capabilities.;0
RLCS Inputs to and outputs from the FCU and DCU Controllers Exhibit 3.2a: Currently installed I-15 RLCS Field Sensors and Devices Devices to be added to the RLCS are shown in Exhibit 3.2b.;0
RLCS Inputs to and outputs from the FCU and DCU Controllers 3.1.3.1.;0
The first is a connection to a Department of Transportation ISSC resource (possibly a WAN connection) via a firewall.;0
All external systems will access RLCS data through this interface.;1
This interface is a one-way output only interface.;1
The second consists of a secure remote dial-in interface through a firewall via a dial-up modem.;0
This is a two-way interface that allows connection into the RLCS network via a remote computer equipped with the application software, and with a user logon authorized for remote access.;0
Functional requirements This section describes the fundamental actions that must occur to accept inputs and produce outputs.;0
It includes explanations of validity checks on inputs, [vendor must complete the validity check information] sequences of operations, and responses to abnormal situations.;0

6) When there is a communication failure within the RLCS network 7) When a computer in the RLCS network goes down 8) Power failure at any controller or workstation 9) When a cabinet ID is changed.;1
10) When the DCUs are in manual mode.;1
1) security sensor activation at either the FCU or DCU.;1
2) When Air pressure, Temperature in cabinets, and Voltages are outside the limits of established thresholds as stored in the database.;1
3.2.2.4.8 If a critical alarm occurs during opening or closing operation, the system shall present the operator with possible actions that can be taken in order to complete the operation.;1
If overriding a device status is needed in order to proceed, the system shall determine if the operator has high enough security and provide advise on how to proceed.;1
3.2.2.4.9.2 The system operator shall be able to override any device and continue with a system operational command sequence.;1
To ?override? a device means to set the status to a normal value even if the device is not functioning in order to continue with a sequence.;0
Field staff would manually operate any device that is not responding to a controller I-15 RLCS Software Requirements Specification command prior to the operator ?overriding? the device status.;1
3.2.2.4.9.3 The process of overriding a device status shall not affect the status of any other device.;1
The validation will occur at each control unit in the system that receives the command.;1
3.2.2.4.9.5 Commands are only forwarded from superior units to inferior ones.;1
This prevents a lower level unit from changing the state of a device which is controlled by either a higher level unit, or by a peer unit.;0
The TSU is superior to the FCUs which are superior to the DCUs.;1
3.2.2.5.2 Failure to receive a valid status after a configurable number of retries shall be considered a device failure.;1
3.2.2.6.2 The RLCS software shall initialize each control unit and device sensor as it is identified.;1
3.2.2.6.2.1 RLCS Software Startup PROCESS: The RLCS software in the field shall first identify the its unit when it starts, by reading the cabinet id.;1
The RLCS software will then proceed to make sure that all the cards required in that unit are present and working properly.;1
The RLCS software will do a control system integrity check ( see requirement 3.0.9) and initialize all the specified tables.;1
If everything is OK the start up process shall not exceed 30 seconds.;1
The RLCS software shall then monitor all the devices and send the current status to the FCU or TSU every 2 seconds (or at the rate specified in the System Control Parameters for the current mode).;1
Updating non-volatile memory-based tables shall be sufficient to accommodate future changes to the roadway.;1
Some examples of future changes to the facility include, change in the number of closure devices.;0
change in the number of entrances to lanes, change in the number of changeable message signs, Different closure devices, and different operational procedures.;0
Device command log shall not be editable by users.;1
3.2.2.8.1.1 System Operation Command Log: Contains system operational commands issued with time stamp, operator ID, unit where the command was issued at and shall include failed or aborted commands.;1
System Operation command shall not be editable by users.;1
3.2.2.8.1.2 The Problem Work Order Log will be generated automatically with failure information at the time of failure.;1
Some input fields in this log will allow the operator to input status and emergency notification information.;1
3.2.2.8.1.3 Alarm Log will contain information about warning and critical alarm events.;1
3.2.2.8.1.4 The Daily Diary Log will be generated automatically when a user with Operator authority logs on to the system.;1
Some input fields in this log will allow the operator to input free form text information.;1
3.2.2.8.1.5 Special Event Log: This log will contain information about scheduled special events.;1
3.2.2.8.1.6 System Operation Schedule Log: This log contains information about scheduled operations.;1
3.2.3.3.3 The status of a closure device, which was previously closed at the current entrance, changes to ?unknown? or ?open?, without an operator- initiated command.;1
3.2.3.4 At any point in an opening sequence, the sequence shall be halted if the status of a closure device for the opposite direction of travel changes to ?unknown? or ?open?.;1
The RLCS shall also store, process, and retrieve all data necessary to secure the system from unauthorized use.;1
A commercial off-the-shelf database management system shall be used for this function.;1
The RLCS database stores information needed to operate the RLCS as well as historical transaction data to generate reports of system operations.;1
3.2.4.3 Update and read Security information The Personnel Security Level entity stores information about the five attributes used to restrict access to the RLCS: Command Level, Device, Mode, Workstation, and System Functions.;1
3.2.4.4 Command levels are of three types: ?Status Only?, ?Control?, and ?Override?.;1
Users with ?Status Only? command level security may not issue any control commands at any level (device, macro, or super macro).;1
?Control? allows a user to issue control commands, and is a higher level of security.;1
?Override? allows a user to temporarily change the status of a device in the database for a configurable period of time in order to allow a command sequence to continue.;1
Commands shall be classified in these categories (1) Device control commands.;1
These are single commands that change the state of a device.;0
This is a group of two or more sequentially executed commands that change the states of two or more closure devices.;0
Example Close CMS 1 through 4.;0
(3) Super Macro Commands.;0
Example Close South end Location 2.;0
(4) Override Commands.;0
This type of command changes the database value for the device only and does not send a device command to the field device.;0
(5) Device Status Commands.;0
These are commands that request the status of a device.;0
(6) Diagnostic Commands.;0
These are commands that run diagnostic on devices or controllers.;0
Example: Run diagnostics on the communication card in DCU1.;0
3.2.4.5 The system shall will employ a one-way hash function as an aid to maintaining the integrity of the data and software in the field.;1
The hash value returned by the function shall will be at least 128 bits in length.;1
The MD5 algorithm is acceptable for this purpose.;0
3.2.4.5.1 At each time, one or more of the above item types, listed under ?Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory?, is created or modified, a UTC date/time stamp shall will be updated.;1
The update of the time stamp shall will be the last step in the process which builds the time stamped code/data section.;1
3.2.4.5.2 The system shall will also, for each control unit in the system, produce a table of the returned ?one-way hash function? (Message Digest) values, of each of the ?Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory? items.;1
The returned ?Message Digest? values shall will be stored as hexadecimal characters.;1
The appropriate ?Message Digest? table shall will be maintained in non-volatile memory in each system control unit.;1
3.2.4.5.3 The system will provide for periodic verification that current, recomputed ?Message Digest? values, for each unit in the system, correspond with ?record? values computed by the development processMD5 algorithm.;1
The periodic evaluation shall will occur at least once a day.;1
If the failure occurs in checking the non-volatile memory items, the system shall will prevent the affected unit from being used in control sequences.;1
3.2.4.5.4 The system shall will provide for ?Message Digest? verification requests for a given unit by operator command.;1
3.2.4.5.5 For system login purposes, the hash function shall will also be used to encrypt user passwords.;1
Input Entities: All RLCS log data and any other entities exported to the COTS reporting tool.;0
Output Entities: None to RLCS database, only output reporting parameters to COTS reporting package data store, and report output to display, print, or file storage.;0

3.3.4.2 The RLCS shall support at a minimum the 4 daily ?normal? mode open and close scheduled operations plus at least the same number of ?emergency? and ?maintenance? mode scheduled events.;1
3.3.5 Data Processing and Security Priority: Must have The database retrieval and update response time shall not impact any other performance requirements such as the GUI response time or monitoring and control responses.;1
In other words, the database performance is a component of the total response time for any other performance requirement.;1
If the GUI is required to reflect change in status within 2 seconds, then the database update time must be less than 2 seconds.;1
3.3.6.2 The raw data used to create reports shall be kept in the RLCS for a minimum period of 13 months prior to backing up to tapes or other secondary storage media.;1
Depending on user needs for fast report response times (such as for ad hoc reporting), database extracts may be created for reporting purposes only.;1
3.3.7 Communications Priority: Must have 3.3.7.1 RLCS system components will communicate via the private communications networks established by Department of Transportation District 11 prior to the development of the RLCS.;1
Any operator or system command, which changes the state of field control devices, must be checked for integrity at multiple levels in the system.;1
Valid checksum algorithms must be employed to check the integrity of messages between units.;1
= 164 kbits/s At a 30 second polling interval, the transmission rate drops to 10.9 kbits/s.;1
# of Sensors* Bytes per status command Polling Interval Transmission Rate (kbits/second) *The # of sensors is the total # of sensors in Exhibit 3.2a and Exhibit 3.2b combined.;0
Polling all system devices constitutes the majority (over 99.99%) of transactions on the network.;1
The opening and closing sequences that occur four times daily, add only a small fraction to the total system load.;1
This entity can reflect items scheduled in advance that repeat at a set period, and can reflect items entered into the system for immediate execution.;1

This document is under NDA with the SCE-API consortium.;0
This document describes a proposal for a standard C/C++ modeling interface for emulators and other veri?cation platforms.;0
The interface provides multiple communication channels between software models running on a host workstation and a device under test (DUT) represented as a structural hardware netlist running on a veri?cation platform such as an emulator.;0
Existing standard veri?cation interfaces were designed to meet the needs of design teams of over 10 years ago.;0
A new type of interface is needed to meet the veri?cation challenges of the next 10 years.;0
This document is a proposal for a multichannel communication interface that addresses these challenges.;0
This new interface must cater to the needs of both emulation end users and emulation suppliers. Emulation Customer Problems to be Solved by SCE-API 0;0
All emulators on the market today have proprietary APIs.;0
The proliferation of APIs makes it very di?icult for software-based veri?cation products to port to the different emulators, thus restricting the solutions available to customers.;0
This also leads to low productivity and low return on investment (ROI) for emulator customers who build their own solutions. 0;0
APIs? which exist today are oriented to gate-level and not system-level veri?cation. 0;0
This document is directed to members of the Standard Co-Emula?on API (SCE-API) technical committee.;0
The committee members represent a consortium of EDA customers and EDA tool suppliers dedicated to the creation of a breakthrough high?performance common emulation API.;0
The founding participants in the consortium are AptiX, CoWare, Ikos Systems, Mentor Graphics, ST Microelectronics, Synopsys, and TransEDA.;0
The scope of this document shall be restricted to what is speci?cally referred to herein as the Standard Co-Emulation AP]: Modeling Interface (SCE-MI).;0
This modeling interface is intended to be one of possibly several parts making up the whole SCE-API standard.;0
In the future, SCE-API may be expanded to include additional parts to handle such features as debug and control, code coverage, etc.;0
This document is intended to describe an overall use model of the SCE-MI, a tutorial illustrating this use model, and a formal functional speci?cation of the SCE-MI API itself.;0
Future revisions of the document will continue to re?ect the feedback from members of the SCE-API technical committee.;0

IEEE Standard Hardware Description Language;0
Based on the Verilog Hardware Description Language (IEEE Std 1364-1995) - IEEE Computer Society 4.;0
Each communication channel is designed to transport untimed messages of arbitrary abstraction between its two end points or ?ports? of a channel.;0
These message channels are not meant to connect software models to each other but rather to connect software proxy models to message port interfaces on the hardware side of the design.;0
The means to interconnect software models to each other must be provided by a software modeling and simulation environment such as SystemC which is beyond the scope of this document.;0
This can be summarized with the following recommendations regarding the API: 0 Do not use it to bridge event based or sub?cycle accurate simulation environments 0;0
It is possible but not ideal to bridge cycle accurate simulation environments 0;0
It is ideal for bridging an untimed simulation environment with a cycle accurate simulation environment There are many references in the document to SystemC as the modeling environment for untimed software models.;0
This is because, although SystemC is capable of modeling at the cycle accurate RTL abstraction level, it is also considered ideally suited for untimed modeling.;0
As such, it has been chosen for use in many of the examples in this document.;0
While the software side of the described interface is generic in its ability to be used in any C/C++ modeling environment, it is optimized to be compatible with SystemC (see reference [1]).;0
Similarly, its hardware side is optimized to prevent undue throttling of an emulator during a co-modeling session run.;0
Throughout this document the term emulation or emulator is used to denote a structural or RTL model of a DUT running in an emulator, rapid prototype, or other simulation environment including software HDL simulators.;0
Such bottlenecks could severely compromise the performance of an emulator which is otherwise very fast.;0
Similarly, it can take thousands of clocked events on the hardware side to generate the content of a message on a channel originating from the hardware that is ultimately destined for an untimed software model. Document Layout;0
The document is divided into the following three maj or chapters: 0 Chapter 2.0: An overall description and use model for the SCE Modeling Interface (SCE-MI). 0;0
Chapter 3.0: A tutorial that shows how the use model is used in a simple application. 0 Chapter 4.0: A formal functional speci?cation of the API itself. Document Conventions 0;0
Any references to actual literal names that might be found in source code, identi?ers that are part of the API, ?le names, and other literal names are represented in courier font. 0 Key concepts words, or phrases are often italicized.;0
Also, there is a good chance that any italicized text may have a de?nition in the glossary, so the reader is directed there for a more detailed meaning of a term. High Level Description;0
The diagram in Figure 1 shows a high level View of how SCE-MI interconnects untimed software models to structural hardware transactor and DUT models.;0
The SCE-MI provides a transport infrastructure between the emulator and host workstation sides of each channel, that interconnects transactor models in the emulator to C (untimed or RTL) models on the workstation.;0
Again it is important to note that for purposes of this document, the term emulator can be used interchangeably with any simulator capable of executing RTL or gate-level models, including software HDL simulators.;0
These interconnects are provided in the form of message channels that run between the software side and the hardware side of the SCE-MI infrastructure.;0
Each message channel has two ends.;0
The end on the software side is called a message port proxy which is a C++ obj ect that gives API access to the channel.;0
The end on the hardware side is a message port macro that is instantiated inside a transactor and connected to other components in the transactor.;0
Each message channel is either an input or an output channel with respect to the hardware side.;0
It is important to note that message channels are not unidirectional or bidirectional busses in the sense of hardware signals, but are rather more like network sockets that use message passing protocols.;0
It is the job of the transactors to serve as abstraction gaskets that decompose messages arriving on input channels from the software side into sequences of cycle accurate events that are to be clocked into the DUT.;0
This allows the transactor to ?freeze? controlled time while performing message composition and decomposition operations. Support for Multi-Threaded Environments;0
The SCE-MI is designed to couple easily with multi-threaded environments such as SystemC, yet it also functions just as easily in single-threaded environments such as simple C programs.;0
A special service [0017 function (see section 4.3.3.6 on page 68) is provided by the SCE-MI that can be called from an application to give the SCE-MI infrastructure an opportunity to service its communication channels.;0
It is inside this function that queued up input messages can be sent to the hardware side and arriving output messages can be dispatched to the appropriate software models.;0
A maj or goal of this speci?cation is to address the needs of three target audiences, each with a distinct interest in their use of the interface.;0
The target audiences are as follows:;0
While end users might be aware of the need for a ?gasket? that bridges these two levels of abstraction, they want the creation of these abstraction bridges to be as painless and automated as possible.;0
Ideally, the end users are not required to be familiar with the details of SCE-MI API.;0
Rather, on the hardware side, they might wish to rely on the transactor implementor (see next section) to provide prede?ned transactor models that can directly interface to their DUT.;0
Additionally, the transactor implementor can supply proxy models on the software side that provide untimed ?sockets? to the transactors.;0
2.2.3 SCE-MI Infrastructure Implementor;0
The SCE-MI infrastructure implementor is interested in furnishing a working implementation of an SCE-MI that runs on some vendor supplied veri?cation platform (probably their own).;0
Such a con?guration can be used to test a processor DUT that has some communications interfaces that can include an ethemet adapter, PCI interface, and a USB interface.;0
Once we do this however, we might still want to test them with the unaltered, untimed testbench models.;0
The SCE-MI infrastructure performs the task of serving as a transport layer that guarantees delivery of messages back and forth between the message port proxy and message port ends of each channel.;0
Messages arriving on input channels are presented to the transactors through message inputports.;0
In fact, the testbench models do not know that the messages have actually come from and gone to a totally different abstraction level.;0
The DUT input proxies have the job of accepting untimed messages from various C models and sending them to the message input port proxies for transport to the hardware side.;0
The DUT output proxies establish callbacks that monitor the message output port proxies for arrival of messages from the hardware side.;0
Rather, they can be considered arbitrary data types ranging in abstraction from a simple bit, boolean or integer, on up to something as complex as a C++ class or even some aggregate of objects.;0
It is in this form that messages can be transported either by value or by reference over abstract ports between fully untimed software models of the sort described in Figure 2 and, in substantially more detail in reference [1].;0
However, before messages can be transported over an SCE-MI message channel, their content must be serialized into a large bit vector by the DUT proxy model.;0
Conversely, after a message arrives on a message output channel and is dispatched to a DUT output proxy model, it might be de-serialized back into an abstract C++ data type.;0
At this point, it is ready for presentation at the abstract output ports (to use SystemC terminology) of the DUT proxy to the connected software testbench models.;0
Meanwhile, on the hardware side, a message arriving on the message input channel can trigger many dozens to hundreds of clocks of event activity.;0
It is the job of the transactor to perform this decomposition of message data content to sequences of clocked events that are presented to the DUT hardware model inputs.;0
Note that, for the most part, the term message can be used interchangeably with transaction.;0
But if they are shown for all cycles of the uncontrolledclock, the waveforms would appear more like the uncontrolled time View shown in Figure 4.;0
In this View, the controlled clock is suspended or disabled and the DUT is ?;0
? Suppose a system has multiple controlled clocks (of possibly differing frequencies) and multiple transactors controlling them.;0
Any one of these transactors has the option of stopping any clock.;0
If this happens, all controlled clocks in the system stop in unison.;0
Furthermore, all other transactors that did not themselves stop the clock, must still sense that the clocks were globally stopped and continue to function correctly even though they themselves had no need to stop the clock.;0
A transactor might need to stop the controlled clock when performing operations that involve decomposition or composition of transactions arriving from, or going to a message channel. 0;0
All transactors are clocked by a free running uncontrolled clock that is provided by the SCE-MI hardware side infrastructure.;0
The models to be run on the workstation are compiled using a common C/C++ compiler or possibly obtained from other sources such as third party vendors in the form of IP, ISS simulators, etc.;0
The compiled models are linked with the software side of the SCE-MI infrastructure to form an executable program.;0
Part of this compile process can involve adding additional structure to the bridge netlist, that properly interfaces the user supplied netlist to the SCE-MI infrastructure implementation components.;0
Put more simply, the infrastructure linker is responsible for providing the core of the SCE-MI interface macros on the hardware side.;0
Among the parameters it analyzes are the following:;0
The software executable compiled and linked in the software compilation phase is now executed which causes all the software models to be constructed in the workstation process image space.;0
Once this binding occurs, the co-modeling session can proceed.;0
SCE-MI Interface Components;0
The SCE-MI run time environment consists of a set of interface components on both the hardware side and the software side of the interface, each of which provides a distinct level of functionality.;0
They are introduced in this section, and each is discussed in more detail later in this document. Hardware Side Interface Components;0
The interface components presented by the SCE-MI hardware side consist of a small set of macros that provide connection points between the transactors and the SCE-MI infrastructure.;0
These compactly de?ned and simple to use macros fully present all necessary aspects of the interface to the transactors and the DUT.;0
From the point of View of this speci?cation, these macros are simply represented as empty Verilog or VHDL models with clearly de?ned port and parameter interfaces.;0
This is analogous to a software API speci?cation that de?nes function prototypes of the API calls without showing their implementations.;0
The macros are parametrized such that, at the point of instantiation, crucial parameters that will dictate the dimensions of the SCE-MI bridge to software can be easily speci?ed by the user.;0
It is the job of the in?astmcture linker to learn the values of these parameters and customize implementation components inserted underneath the macros accordingly.;0
Any number of these macros can be instantiated as is required by the system.;0
One SceMiMessageInPort macro must be instantiated for each required message input channel, and one SceMiMessageOutPort macro for each output channel.;1
Message port macro bit-widths are parametrized at the point of instantiation.;0
Exactly one SceMiClockPort macro is instantiated for each de?ned clock in the system.;0
This SceMiClockPort macro instance will, Via a set of parameters, fully characterize a particular clock.;1
The SceMiClockPort macro is instantiated at the top level and provides a controlled clock and reset directly to the DUT.;1
The SceMiClockPort macro instance is named and assigned a reference ClockNum parameter that is used to associate it with one or more counterpart SceMiClockControl macros inside one or more transactors.;1
The SceMiClockControl macro is used by its transactor for all clock controlling operations for its associated clock.;1
These two macros are mutually associated by the ClockNum parameter and every SceMiClockPort macro must have a minimum of one SceMiClockControl macro associated with it.;1
Connection of SCE-MI Macros on Hardware Side to Transactor and DUT ul;0
This example features a single transactor interacting with a DUT and interfacing to the software side through a SceMiMessageInPort and a SceMiMessageOutPort.;0
In addition, it de?nes a single clock that is controlled by the transactor internally using the SceMiClockControl macro.;0
This clock drives the DUT from the top level through a SceMiClockPort macro.;0
Because the transactor encapsulates the message port macros and the SceMiClockControl macro, the end user only has to be aware of how to hook up to the transactor itself and to the SceMiClockPort macro.;0
The SceMiClockPort macro instantiation is where all the clock parameters are speci?ed.;0
This tutorial tries to illustrate how the use model of the SCE-MI can be applied in a multi- threaded SystemC environment.;0
It assumes some familiarity with the concepts of SystemC including abstractports, autonomous threads, slave threads, module and port de?nition, and module instantiation and interconnect.;0
The Routed design is a small design that simulates air passengers traveling from Origins to Destinations by traversing various interconnected Pipes and Hubs in a RouteMap.;0
In this design, the Origins and Destinations are the transactors and the RouteMap model is the DUT. Each Origin transactor interfaces to a SceMiMessageInPort to gain access to messages aniving from the software side.;0
Each Destination transactor interfaces to a SceMiMessageOutPort to send messages to the software side.;0
There is also an OrigDest module that has both an Origin and Destination transactor contained within it.;0
The numbers shown by the directed arcs are the travel time (in hours) to travel the indicated Pipe. Layover time in each Hub is two hours.;0
The RouteMap is initialized by injecting TeachRoute messages for the entire system through the Waltham Origin transactor.;1
In other words, by ?rst teaching closer hubs.;0
This process continues until the entire mesh is initialized, at which point it is ready to serve as a backbone for all air travel activity.;1
After initiating the route con?guration, the testbench then executes the itineraries of 4 passengers over a period of 22 days.;0
Each itinerary consists of several legs, each with scheduled departure from a speci?ed Origin and each with a speci?ed Destination.;0
The scheduled leg is sent as a message token to its designated Origin transactor.;1
It is the job of the transactor to count the number of clocks until the speci?ed departure time before sending the token into the RouteMap mesh. 3.2.2 System Hierarchy;0
The hierarchy of the whole system is textually shown in the following subsections.;0
Note that the interactions shown between the Calendar and Scheduler software side models and the OrigDest, Origin, and Destination hardware side models.;0
Encapsulated within the Origin and Destination transactors are the SceMiMessageInPort, SceMiMessageOutPort, and SceMiClockControl macros.;0
Notice that this diagram more or less follows the structure of the generalized abstraction bridge shown in Figure 3 on page 11.;0
The two software models that interact with the hardware side are the Calendar model and the Scheduler model.;0
These models encapsulate message port proxies which give them direct access to the message channels leading to the Origin and Destination transactors on the hardware side.;0
These two software models are the only ones that are aware of the SCE-MI link.;0
They converse with the other models through SystemC abstract ports.;0
On the hardware side, there is a set of Origin and Destination transactors that service the message channels that interface with the Scheduler and route tokens to or from the DUT.;0
Some locations, such as Anchorage and the UK, are both Origin and Destination (called OrigDest). Functional Requirements Speci?cation: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI) 23 of 94 User?s Guide and Tutorial;0
In addition, there is a ClockAdvancer transactor that interfaces directly with the Calendar model.;0
Each received token is passed to the TokenOut port when the scheduled departure time has matured.;0
Although the Origin transactor has a clock control macro, it does not actively control the clock.;0
Its only use of the clock control macro is to monitor the ReadyForCclock signal to know on which uclocks the cclock is active so that it can properly count cclocks until the scheduled departure time of a pending departure token.;0
Each Destination transactor contains a clock control macro and a message output port macro to send arrival tokens back to the Scheduler on the software side.;0
The arrival tokens represent a passenger emerging from the RouteMap mesh and arriving at a Destination through its TokenIn port.;0
This transactor was chosen to be described in detail because it provides a simple example of clock control and message port interfacing.;0
Normally, OS are clocked through the mesh so if, on any given cycle, a Hub or Destination senses a non?O value on its input port, it knows it has received a token that needs to be processed. Token formats are also shown in Figure 9.;0
A departure token contains the passenger ID, destination ID, and scheduled time of departure.;0
As the departure token travels through the mesh, it collects layover information consisting of the IDs of all the Hubs encountered before reaching its Destination, having been transformed into an arrival token.;0
The arrival token then has a complete record of layover information that is passed back to the software side and displayed to the console.;0
A Hub consists of a Funnel that accepts tokens from up to four different sources, and a Nozzle that routes a token up to four different destinations.;0
The Nozzle contains a small RouteTable that is initialized at the beginning of the simulation with routing information by receiving TeachRoute tokens. 3.2.3.4;0
The Destination transactor accepts tokens arriving from a point-of?eXit on the Rout eMap and passes them to the message output port.;0
The Destination transactor uses clock control to avoid losing potentially successive tokens arriving from the RouteMap (through the TokenIn input) to this destination portal.;0
It de-asseits the readyForCclock in the event that a token comes in, but the message output port is not able to take it because of tokens simultaneously arriving at other destination portals.;0
This way, it guarantees that the entire Rout eMap is disabled until all tokens are olf-loaded from the requesting Destination transactors.;0
In fact there is only one cclock in the entire system that is speci?ed at the default 1/1 ratio. Notice also that, although the ClockAdvancer handshakes with the message output port, the data that it sends is always 0.;0
The software side of the Routed design is written completely in SystemC and C++.;0
It is compiled as an executable program that links with the SCE-MI software side.;0
3.2.4.1 The System Model: Interconnect 0f SystemC Modules;0
The System model is the top level ?software netlist? of SystemC modules ( sciMODULE () ).;0
It speci?es the construction and interconnect of the component models as well.;0
These can be thought of as abstract signals that interconnect abstract ports.;0
The parametrized data type associated with each scilinkimp<> denotes the data type of the message that the channel is capable of transferring from an output abstract port to an input abstract port.;0
However, passing messages by reference is more ef?cient but care must be taken in their use.;0
After each child module is constructed, its abstract ports are mapped to one of the declared interconnect channels.;0
It is important to stress that SystemC channels, while conceptually the same, are distinctly di?erent from SCE-MI message channels.;0
Both types of channels pass messages, but SystemC channels are designed strictly to pass messages of arbitrary C++ data types between SystemC modules.;1
An entire simulation can be built of j ust software models communicating with each other.;0
See reference [1] for more details about SystemC interconnect channels.;0
SCE-MI message channels have a completely different interface and are optimized for implementing abstraction bridges between a software subsystem and a hardware subsystem.;1
These two threads are the only autonomous threads in the system.;1
All the other code is executed inside slave threads.;1
The ?rst routine de?ned is the errorHandler () .;1
This is the master error handling function that is registered with the SCE-MI.;1
This method returns a pointer to an SceMi obj ect that manages the whole SCE-MI software side infrastructure.;1
Next the System model described in the previous section is constructed.;0
The -1 parameter tells it to go inde?nitely until the program decides to end.;1
How the program ends is explained in the next section.;0
The SceMiDispatcher Module:;0
Interfacing with the SCE-MI Service Loop;0
The SceMiDi spatcher module contains an autonomous thread that yields to the SCE-MI infrastructure so that it may service its message port proxies, by making repeated calls to the SceMi: :ServiceLoop () method (see section 4.3.3.6 on page 68).;0
By placing this logic on its own dedicated thread, other models in the system do not have to worry about yielding to the SCE-MI. 34 of 94 Functional Requirements Speci?cation: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI);0
Between each call to the service loop, the autonomous thread yields to other threads in the system by calling the wait () function.;0
Actually, the only other autonomous thread in the Routed system is the one in the Testbench model.;0
Both of these threads are represented by the thick round arrows in Figure 10 on page 30.;0
The other job of the SceMiDi spatcher is shut down the system when it detects a noti?cation on its Done port that the simulation is complete.;1

The product will be as secure as the web browserthat will run the product.;1
The product will be available overthe Internet via the S28 website.;1
Reliability will be ensured by extensive testing by the team members and mentors, if available.;0
Maintainability is a primary goal for this project.;1
For example, using appropriate sub- scenes in the main Flash game to split up the code will allow for easy alteration at a later date.;0
It will later be used as a base for the extension of the existing software itself.;0
This document follows the IEEE standard for software requirements specification documents.;0
PDF is the most popular file format for secure, dependable electronic information exchange.;0
It is used by more than half billion people and has become one of the world?s most trusted technologies.;0
PDF files can be viewed from almost any platform (Macintosh?, Windows?, UNIX? and LINUX? as well as numerous mobile platforms and devices) but the manipulation of these files is not usually free.;0
The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way to handle pdf files efficiently and free through a simple graphical interface.;0
1.2 Document Conventions PDF Split and Merge was created prior to this document, so all requirements stated here are already satisfied.;0
It is very important to update this document with every future requirement and clarify its priority for consistency purposes, so that this document can remain useful.;0
Because of the fact that PDFsam is already implemented, parts of this document have a style similar to a manual document.;0
Some technical information has been included.;0
Readers can refer to Appendix A at the end of the document for terms definition (glossary).;0
This way testing becomes more methodically organized.;0
1.4 Project Scope PDF Split and Merge is a FOSS tool that can split, merge and manipulate PDF documents.;0
It provides a graphical Interface (GUI) and a shell Interface (Console).;0
It is available in two versions, basic and enhanced, both are open source.;0
The GUI provides the user with all the functionality needed to handle a PDF file (or more files together).;0
The functionalities are distributed in plugins.;0
Each plugin performs a specific function and loads in the main GUI.;0
In the basic version, the GUI contains six plugins: - Alternate Mix - Merge/Extract - Rotate - Split - Visual document composer - Visual reorder This is a picture of a plugin of PDFsam The Console is a command-line application.;0
It?s the core application and it provides both the enhanced and the basic features for pdf manipulation.;0
Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective PDF Split and Merge is a multi functional tool for manipulating pdf files.;0
It is free and open source with a GNU General Public License (GPL).;0
Although there are many programs for viewing pdfs, there is not any program to handle pdfs with so many features as PDFsam.;0
The fact that it is open source is an extra motive for the users who have the knowledge to help with the project?s development.;0
In addition, there is also an enhanced version of the software that provides even more capabilities.;0
2.2 Product Features The basic version provides: - Splitting pdf documents (into chapters, single pages, etc).;0
Any of those features can be executed as command prompt from the command line Console application.;0
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics This project refers to several types of users of any computer system.;0
However, this project is meant to be used by two major user classes: 1.;0
General users who can use the software to cover specific needs: - People of all age groups without much experience because the PDFsam interface is pleasant and user friendly and its functions are relatively simple.;0
Open source software developers and contributors: - Software Developers: People with very good knowledge of programming language project, in order to understand and be able to extend project?s source code.;0
The whole project is based on the conception of Free and Open Source Software, so all people are welcome to contribute any way the can/like.;0
2.4 Operating Environment PDFsam is platform independent and it runs on every platform where a Java Virtual Machine is available (requires a JVM version 1.6 or higher).;0
User can change the default value of memory with the appropriate commands if he has to handle large pdf files.;0
Its user interface is written with Java Swing, so anyone who wishes to work on further development of PDFsam has to know this programming language.;0
PDFsam is GNU GPLv2 licensed and the PDFsam-console is dual licensed (GPLv2 and LGPLv2).;0
Everyone, that does or is going to develop or use PDFsam, should agree and fully accept the terms of this kind of license.;0
2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies A working Java Runtime Environment version 1.6 or above is necessary.;0
System Features PDFsam consists of a number of plugins which constitute its basic functions, and some additional features that make the whole process easier and faster.;0
All plugins are located in the ?plugins tree? on the left side of the GUI Interface.;0
This section describes the functional requirements of the application and the features it provides.;0
System features are described in detail to help the future extension and testing of the system.;0
Features stated here are already parts of the implemented system so no prioritization is needed.;0
Priority is needed for features to be developed that will be added to this document later.;0
3.1 System Feature 1 - Split Split a pdf document through the GUI Interface.;1
This plugin allows you to set a number of options that will be used to split the document.;1
3.1.1 Description The user can divide a pdf document into parts, following some options for how to split the document.;1
Then he can save the output pdf files in a directory he wants.;1
3.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences The user has to select the Split option from the plugins tree (or press the ?S? key) to display the split panel.;1
This is a screenshot of the Split plugin The GUI Split panel consists of the following parts: ? Selection panel: The user selects the document he wants to split from a directory.;0
When the file is imported, some information about the file displayed (such as pages number, pdf version?).;1
If the document is protected the user have to enter the password to the appropriate field and then reload the pdf.;1
? Split options: The user can choose between 7 types of splitting: - Burst: the input file will be split in single pages.;1
- Split at this size: the input file will be split in files of the given size (roughly).;1
- Split by bookmark level: the input file will be split at every page linked by the bookmarks of the selected level (this can be very useful if you want to split an e-book in chapters).;1
? Destination folder: The user selects the destination folder for the output files (specific or same as source).;1
Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.;1
? Output options: Here the user can define a pattern that will generate filenames for the output files.;1
The available complex prefixes that can be used are: - [CURRENTPAGE]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with the current page number.;1
The number of digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of ?#? at the prefix name, inside the square brackets (e.g.;1
the prefix [CURRENTPAGE###] will generate prefixes like ?001?, ?002?...).;0
- [TIMESTAMP]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with the current date and time.;1
Time has milliseconds precision and the replaced variable will be something like ?20100206_045107232? that is ?YYYYMMDD_HHmmssSSS?.;1
- [FILENUMBER]: This prefix variable ensures unique output filenames and it's replaced with a file number according to the output order.;1
The number of digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of '#' at the prefix name, inside the square brackets (e.g.;1
It does not ensure unique output filenames and it must be used together with other variables.;1
If it is used alone, the system will use the default filename pattern.;1
It ensures unique output filenames (unless two or more bookmarks have the same name) and it enables variable substitution.;1
It's replaced with the bookmark name.;1
Some characters of the bookmark name could be stripped if they are not valid character for a file name.;1
- If left blank, the output filenames will take the default pattern [CURRENTPAGE] _ [BASENAME].;1
? RUN button: After the user sets all these parameters, he presses the RUN button and the splitting starts.;0
3.1.3 Functional Requirements REQ-1: The user can split only once document at a time.;1
REQ-2: The compression of the output files requires pdf version 1.5 or above.;1

Extract sections of a document into a single document.;1
3.2.1 Description Users can merge many pdf documents or subsections of them together.;1
In the same way, they can extract some sections of a pdf document into a single document.;1
The GUI Merge/Extract panel enables the user to select more than one file to handle.;1
Once the user selects the file/files they are automatically inserted into the selection table with some specific details.;1
Now, the user can change the order and/or select the pages of the file/files that he wants to be included in the final document.;1
In the Page Selection column of the table, user can write: - ?All?: to merge the whole document.;1
- ?page - to page?: to merge pages between ?page? and ?to page? (e.g.;0
The user can change the order of the files by using ?Move Up? and ?Move Down? buttons, or make the list be ordered by the value of a specific column by clicking the header of that column.;1
The user has the ability to export the list of the selected files as an xml file that can be used as an input file for the console ?concat? command, -l option.;1
If the pdf documents contain forms, the user must add that to the merge options.;1
Finally, the user selects the output file path or let the PDFsam create one by default to the same folder as one of the imported files.;1
Also, he can select whether he wants the output file to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated document.;1
The user presses the RUN button to start the merging of the files.;0
3.2.3 Functional Requirements REQ-1: pages number in the page selection must be comprehended.;1

for documents coming from one-sided scanners).;1
The resulting document will be composed by pages taken alternatively from the two input documents.;1
3.3.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences The GUI Alternate Mix panel consists of the following parts: ? Selection panel: The user selects the two documents that he wants to mix from a directory.;1
When the files are imported, some information about the file displayed to the selection table (such as pages number, pdf version?).;1
If the documents are protected the user has to enter the password to the appropriate field and then reload the pdf.;1
The user can change the order of the two files by using ?Move Up? and ?Move Down? buttons, or make the list be ordered by the value of a specific column by clicking the header of that column.;1
? Mix options: The user can modify the following parameters: - Reverse first document: if he wants to take pages from the first document in reverse order (starting from the last page).;1
- Reverse second document: if he wants to take pages from the second document in reverse order (starting from the last page).;0
The default behavior is to take one page from the first document and one from the second one.;1
However this step can be configured by this option telling PDFsam how many pages it should take from one document before switching to the other.;1
? Destination output file: The user selects the destination folder for the output files or let the PDFsam create one by default to the same folder as one of the imported files.;1
Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.;1
? RUN button: After the user sets the parameters, he presses the RUN button and the mixing of the 2 documents starts.;1
3.3.3 Functional Requirements REQ-1: The user can mix only 2 documents at a time (not more or less).;1
This is a screenshot of the Alternate Mix plugin 3.4 System Feature 4 - Rotate Rotates pages of pdf documents.;0
3.4.1 Description The users have the ability to bulk rotate pages in different documents.;1

3.4.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences The GUI Rotate panel consists of the following parts: ? Selection panel: The users select the documents that want to rotate their pages from a directory.;1
When the files are imported, some information about the file displayed to the selection table (such as pages number, pdf version?).;1
If the documents are protected the users has to enter the password to the appropriate field and then reload the pdf.;1
The users cannot select the pages that they want to rotate, so the whole document/documents will be rotated (for specific page rotate refer to section 3.5).;1
? This is a screenshot of the Rotate plugin ? Rotation options: The user can modify the following parameters: - Clockwise rotation (in degrees): the users select the rotation degrees.;1
The rotation will be applied clockwise.;1
- Pages: the users select the pages they want to rotate (All, Even or Odd).;0
? Destination output file: The user selects the destination folder for the output files or let the PDFsam create one by default to the same folder as one of the imported files.;0
Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents.;0
? Output options: Here the user can define a pattern that will generate filenames for the output files.;1
REQ-2: The number of digits that can be used for the unique [FILENUMBER] prefix must be 10 or less.;1
3.5 System Feature 5 - Visually reorder Rotate, reorder and delete specific pages from a pdf document.;1
3.5.1 Description Users want an easy way to manipulate specific pages of a pdf document through a user friendly graphical interface with simple functions.;1
With this plugin they can rotate, reorder or delete selected pages of a pdf file.;1
3.5.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences The GUI Visual reorder panel consists of the following parts: ? Selection panel: The users select the document that they want to manipulate from a directory.;1
The program creates thumbnails for each page of the pdf document and presents them into a subpanel.;1
When the thumbnails load, the users have the following abilities: - Select specific pages by clicking on them through the graphical interface.;1
- Change the order: The user can change pages order by: ? Dragging them.;1
? Using the ?Move Up? and ?Move Down? functions.;1
? Reversing the selected pages: The user can select some pages and reverse their order using the ?Reverse? button.;1
All these conversions can be accessed either by right clicking on the selected pages or by the graphical interface?s buttons.;1

3.8.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences Users can discern the proper function of the application by the messages that are displayed in the log panel.;1
There are 3 kinds of message separating by color: ? Black message (DEBUG or INFO) is just an information about what the application is doing.;0
? Blue message (WARNING) is a Warning telling that there?s an unexpected situation that the application can handle.;0
? Red message (ERROR or FATAL) is an error that PDFsam can?t handle.;1
There is also the possibility to select and copy the log text, clear it, or save the log text to a file.;0
3.9.1 Description Users are allowed to make modifications on PDFsam?s working environment, in order to adapt to their preferences and cover their needs more sufficiently.;1
3.9.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences The user has to select Settings below the plugins tree and the Settings main panel appears with all the available choices that the user can do.;1

This is a screenshot of the Settings main window 3.9.3 Functional Requirements REQ-1: Restart PDFsam application to be the changes applied.;1
? Alt-L: to load the working Environment.;0
? Alt-F4: to close the program.;0
That means that is independent from the operating system of the computer system on which it runs.;0
PDFsam runs on every platform where a Java Virtual Machine is available (requires a JVM version 1.6 or higher).;1
It has been tested on various versions of Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux distributions and Mac OS X.;0
4.4 Communications Interfaces PDFsam is not a web application, so the network communication is only necessary to check for software updates.;1
The Check for updates option in the Settings panel 5.;0
This is designed not to delay the system from other key processes.;0
The response time of the program is direct and the application is considered real-time.;1
Furthermore, the system can check for updates whenever is requested by the user, or automatically when opening the application.;1
In this way PDFsam will be always up-to-date with all new supported features and bug fixes.;1
5.2 Safety Requirements The application must ensure that it leaves untouched the input pdf files.;1
No modification is allowed to these files.;1
5.3 Security Requirements PDFsam does not introduce any security level, since the data it manages is not critical.;0
The users in the application are all equal so there is not the need of any identity management level.;1
5.4 Software Quality Attributes This application provides a pleasant and user friendly graphical interface with relatively simple functions.;1
Any user should be able to use PDFsam without any specific knowledge or experience by reading the user manuals (or the help messages that are embedded in the application).;1
Users only need to provide some pdf documents and with just a few clicks they can perform any action.;1
5.5 Other Requirements ? GNU GPL License The project is released under the GNU General Public License.;1
The philosophy of this license implies some basic principles which apply to the project.;0
The GPL is a free software license, and therefore it permits people to use and even redistribute the software without being required to pay anyone a fee for doing so.;0
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.;0
Appendix 6.1 Appendix A: Glossary PDF (Portable Document Format): is a file format created by Adobe Systems in 1993 for document exchange.;0
PDFsam (PDF Split and Merge): The software described in this document.;0
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): is the Java software that needs a computer in order to run Java applications.;0
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): is a platform-independent execution environment that converts Java bytecode into machine language and executes it.;0
The JVM is the instance of the JRE, comes into action when a Java program is executed.;0
When execution is complete, this instance is garbage- collected.;0
IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers): IEEE is the world?s largest professional association advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity.;0
SRS Document (Software Requirements Specification Document): is a complete description of the behavior of the system to be developed.;0
It is intended to guarantee freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users.;0
Privacy and security policies for web-based systems are often developed as an afterthought.;0
The implications are significant because the systems? requirements, policies and functionality are often misaligned and/or in conflict with each other.;0
Organizations risk customer mistrust based upon customer perceptions of conflicting privacy statements.;0
The identification of high-level goals is fundamental to requirements analysis specification process.;0
This can be achieved by asking 'why' questions about the operational descriptions of the system available.;0
Goals are important in the requirements engineering process because they bring completeness and ease of readability to the requirements.;0
They also provide rationale for requirements and help detect conflicts.;0
On the other hand, scenarios are used to specify desired behavior of the system and are the means of communication among stakeholders.;0
Additionally, they support trade-offs amongst design alternatives.;0
Based on the utility of goals and scenarios, there is a need to develop a tool, which will assist analysts in the scenario and goal mining, reconciliation and management processes.;0
All goals are fully traceable to the policies in which they are stated and are distinguished as either policy goals (strategic goals) or scenario goals (tactical goals) in each policy.;0
This tool will provide strong management, which will offer flexible user defined conditions (like ID, keywords, taxonomy, subject, actor, and occurrences).;1
The tool will also support automatic multi-user analysis results comparison.;1
For example, each analyst can classify goals separately and the tool can automatically check the differences in their classification results for their resolution.;0
Requirements engineers, Chief Privacy Officers (CPO), policy analysts or auditors will be able to use this tool.;0
This document specifies the services that the tool will provide and the constraints under which the system must operate.;0
It contains the following sections: Description of Modules: This section contains a detailed description of the contents of each module.;0
FR: Functional Requirements: This section specifies the operational services that the tool will provide to its users.;0
NFR: Non-Functional Requirements: This section specifies the properties like accuracy, performance etc.;0

? Scenario Specification and Management Module - This module supports scenario management in the tool.;0
? Requirements Specification Module- This module supports the requirements for a system.;0
? Legal Compliance ? Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF) module- This section defines the functional requirements that support RACAF.;0
Module Requirements This section outlines the services to be provided by the tool.;0
Each functional requirement includes: the purpose of the requirement, a brief description, the origin of the requirement and the priority of the requirement.;0
These priorities have been set based on discussions with the stakeholders.;0
SPRAT is a tool bench and will support several other tools.;1
The software will be designed keeping all the layers in mind.;0
But this summer the focus is on implementing the database and high and medium priority requirements for SPRAT and also implement RACAF.;0
Priority Level 1 High 2 Medium 3 Low Priority Description High priority requirements are critical and must be satisfied.;0
The system may fail if the respective high priority requirements are not satisfied.;0
Additionally, security related requirements are categorized as high priority.;0
Medium priority requirements are important and desirable, but will not cause the system to fail if not satisfied.;0
These requirements are needed by Qingfeng He for the development of RACAF.;0
Low priority requirements are desirable but not necessary.;0
These requirements are non-critical and can be postponed for implementation in later versions of the system.;0

This is a conscious process and easy to conclude.;0
Information is voluntarily given, shared and used.;0
For instance, emails, surveys, forms.;0
This is a subconscious process and difficult for consumers to conclude.;0
Information is voluntarily given, shared and used.;0
Traceability: The ability to trace the history, application or location of an item or activity by means of recorded identification.;0

The system will be called STEWARDS: Sustaining the Earth's Watersheds ? Aincultural Research Data System.;0
1.2 About this Document and its Readers The system requirements specification document describes what the system is to do, and how the system will peIfOIm each function.;0
The audiences for this document include the system developers and the users.;0
The system developer uses this document as the authority on designing and building system capabilities.;0
The users review the document to ensure the documentation completely and accurately describes the intended functionality.;0
This version ? version 1.0 - provides general desc1iptions of the system.;0
The system developer should review the document to ensure there is adequate information for defining an initial design of the system.;0
The users should review the document to affirm the features desc1ibed are needed, to clarify features, and to identify additional features needed within the system.;0
The next version ? version 2.0 ? will be the result of more detailed requirements analysis.;0
When version 2.0 is WIitten, the system developer and users will be asked to review this document.;0
The document is structured to follow IEEE 830-1998 standards for recording system requirements.;0
1.3 Proj ect Scope As part of the Conseivation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), twelve ARS Benchmark Watersheds will support watershed-scale assessment of environmental effects of USDA conservation program implementation.;0
The ARS Benchmark Watersheds represent primaiily rainfed cropland, although some of the watersheds also contain irrigated cropland, grazingland, wetlands, and confined animal feeding operations.;0
Three additional ARS watersheds may be added in the future to represent additional land uses.;0
Environmental effects and bene?ts will be estimated primarily for water and soil resources, with some assessment of wildlife habitat and air quality benefits in some watersheds.;0
The basic requirement for STEWARDS is to deliver consistent high quality data in support of the CEAP watershed-scale assessment from a one-stop data portal to the CEAP Clients and, in time, the public at large.;1
The data system consists two main parts -- a central database management system for the storage and management of data, and a client application to allow users access and interact with the data.;1
The data stored in the database can be Viewed and downloaded using graphical and tabular interface tools.;1
The data system will serve as a repository where diverse end-users can access, search, analyze, Visualize, and report various types of integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations.;1
"Types of data will be diverse, including biophysical data (i.e., point-based in time and/or space, spatially variable data, time series), data about land use, management, and conservation practices; and economic data.";1
The intention of the team is that ARS researchers at watershed locations retain primary responsibility for data collection and management.;0
Sites may chose to retain existing data management protocols or change location protocols to those of STEWARDS.;1
However, STEWARDS must have the capability to translate data from location-specific formats into the standardized STEWARDS formats.;1
Data on STEWARDS will not be available to the public in real time.;1
Access to real-time data will remain at the discretion of each location research team.;1
Instead, annual or more frequent updates from location databases to STEWARDS will be made by the watersheds? staffs after the locations have completed their quality assurance procedures.;0
This product is a new, centralized data system.;0
Source data for this system are the long-terrn ARS watersheds, with those participating in the CEAP project expected to participate in this data system first.;1
2.2 Product Features The data system consists two main parts -- a central database management system for the uploading, storage, and management of data, and a client application to allow users access and interact with the data.;1
Diverse end-users can access, search, analyze, Visualize, download, and report various types of integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations.;1
"Types of data will include biophysical data (i.e., point-based in time and/or space, spatially variable data, time series), data about land use, management, and conservation practices; and economic data.";1
System operator: Staff at OCIO responsible for maintaining executable code, requiring full access to all aspects of the system.;0
Data operations manager: Staff, probably at OCIO, responsible for data archiving and maintenance, requiring read/write/modify privileges to all data in the system.;0
This includes the role commonly thought of as a Database Administrator (DBA).;0
Watershed uploaders: Staff in the watersheds who have responsibility to upload local data requiring write access to space allocated to their specific watershed.;0
ARS users: ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes.;0
These would likely be conversant with the general characteristics of the data content, and to a lesser extent have abilities manipulating Views of the data using database tools such as envisioned for this database system.;0
These users will need user/password authentication to enable user settings management and to have access to data protected through the confidentiality agreements among agencies participating in CEAP.;1
Research users: Non?ARS scientists, engineers, and support staff who require ARS watershed data for research purposes.;0
These would have similar characteristics and needs as ARS users, but because of the agency-level confidentiality issues, could not access the password-protected sensitive data.;0
Public users: Eventual release of the database system to the general public will add university and agency researchers who would appear similar in training to the primary users, but also would add clients with the entire range of training and interests.;0
These users would have access to the public data without need for authentication.;1
2.4 Operating Environment The rule for selecting hardware and software is that the components/application must be functionally efficient, capable of interfacing with other software, and easy to maintain.;1
The System shall operate with the following Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and 6.0, Netscape Communicator version 4.7, Netscape versions 6 and 7, and FireFOX.;1
The System shall operate on Certified and Accredited servers running the current corporate approved versions of operating systems as appropriate.;1
The Data Management portion of the system shall permit user access from the corporate Intranet and, if a user is authorized for outside access through the corporate firewall, from an Internet connection at the user?s home.;1
The Data Research and Reporting portion of the system shall provide public access to reViewed and approved data sets.;1
Therefore, the web applications will be implemented to run on the server side as much as possible.;1
Also, it is required to test the application using different platforms, connection speeds, screen settings, colors/graphics, and browsers.;1
Portability: The application codes generated during prototyping may not run properly when re-hosting the data system to a non-Windows OS or transferring the data system to another location.;0
Data uploading and management will likely be done as infrequently as once a year.;0
This fact greatly limits the complexity of the user interface and the learning curve needed for completing this task.;0
system shall use the current corporate standard Microsoft SQL Server database engine.;1
The system shall be in compliance with all Accessibility, Web Design, and Security policies applicable.;1
As part of standard operating procedures, a testing plan will be documented during the Design phase.;0
The testing plan will be based on user roles, modules or use cases, required tasks and expected outcomes.;0
A tutorial will provide a quick start, a walk-thru of major system features, and further reference source for the complete system features.;1
An online hierarchical and cross-linked help system in HTML will describe and illustrate all sy stem functions.;1
An online form will enable users to request help.;1
Frequently asked questions will be screened for the FAQ pages.;1
The user's guide (or user manual) will contain sufficient information and instructions required to access and use the data system.;1
Overview of the system features and architecture.;0
Instructions for accessing the system.;0
Samples of screens, where appropriate.;0
If a location has inadequate resources, the minimal data required for CEAP analyses will be identified and the data team will provide additional support to that location.;1
This may result in a location?s data coming into the system later than scheduled.;0
Team leaders anticipate availability of the operational platform at the ARS OCIO level.;0
Pilot and, as a contingency, operational data systems may be developed and maintained at El Reno or other research locations.;1
It is anticipated that funding from NRCS will partially support this activity through FY07.;0
If that funding were not available or insuf?cient in future years, base funds at the locations and/or discretionary funds from the Area and Headquarters funds would support the activity but the timelines would be adjusted.;0
Help desk funding will be determined from staffing needs identified during the design phase and a proposal will then be made to NPS.;1
3.1.1 Description and Priority The database management system should be stable and secured, have high performance (in terms of speed and efficiency/effectiveness), and be easy to maintain.;1
This component is central to the effort and is thus of highest priority.;0
3.1.2 Use Case Scenarios The team will elicit user requirements from a cross-section of user class members (see section 2.3) to accurately and completely describe the expected uses and functionality of the system.;1
The summation of responses will lead to an accurate and complete inventory of user requirements.;0
"The database will support a variety of data types and formats, including but not limited to: spatial data - vector, raster, imagery, and tabular; tabular data ? static and time-series; spreadsheets, documents; reports; photographs, and URL links.";1
Maintenance and reporting of uncertainty or error in measured data, in spatial components of GIS data, and in modeling output.;0
Reporting of uncertainty may take place on an individual sample basis, on a method or procedural basis, or on an entire database.;1
Models will require speci?c input data and will generate output data during the calibration and validation phases, sensitivity analyses, and exploratory scenarios.;1
The current scope of the STEWARDS system is to provide measured data for input to the model and for comparison to output.;1
1: View entire universe of watersheds from top-level screen for selection Design tools to navigate the individual watershed sites and their data.;0
FR-2.2: View watershed descriptive data Summary descriptions of research watersheds, stations, and instmments that are useful in describing the research activities should be accessible.;1
This information would not be considered ?formal? metadata.;0
Charting tools in association with the query engine are desirable.;0
FR-2.5: Generate tabular reports of selected data Provide access to CEAP-related reports, tables, and project documents.;0
FR-2.6: Visualize, query, and download spatial data Agricultural research data are inherently spatial in nature.;0
STEWARDS will provide web-based geographic information tools to allow site-speci?c data to be Viewed within their spatial context.;1
These tools will provide browse and query functionality and support links to download spatial data and their associated tabular data.;1
FR-2.7 : Browse, Visualize, and download agricultural modeling data and results Much of the initial effort in CEAP will focus on the use of agricultural models (e.g.;0
SWAT, AmlAGNPS) in the CEAP watersheds.;0
Users will be able to examine the data used in the modeling effort, Visualize the results in their spatial context, and download the model input data and results.;1
System Requirements Speci?cation for S T E WARDS Page 8 FR-3: lVlETADATA FR-3 .;0
1: Maintain metadata database Develop and maintain a metadata database that provides browse and query access to formal descriptions of the database elements.;1
Provide tools for database contributors to create and upload metadata compatible with the STEWARDS metadata database.;0
FR-3.2: Browse and query watershed metadata by theme or location Develop search tools that query watershed, station, and instrument metadata across the STEWARDS database.;0
Metadata query tools will support query by location, theme, and keyword.;1
The STEWARDS database will maintain a metadata report for each database in STEWARDS.;1
The metadata of individual datasets should be created at the local watershed sites for local use and for populating a CEAP metadata database.;1
Elements of the STEWARDS Metadata system will include: Metadata standard Adopt a metadata standard that is compliant with Federal regulations.;1
The current Federal standards for spatial data are the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (version 2.;0
There are some indications that the Federal government may implement the ISO 19115 geographic information/metadata standard in the future.;0
If this occurs, the CEAP database team will evaluate conversion of metadata.;0
Metadata input tool Implement a metadata input tool that supports creating and editing of metadata in the chosen format.;1
A likely scenario involves a web-based wizard which allows users to specify particulars of a data set, and then save those answers and relate them to a particular project, so that these selections can be re-used in future uploading operations.;0
Metadata query system Implement a web-based browse-and-query tool for searching STEWARDS metadata.;1
Queries by location, theme, and keyword will be supported.;1
A likely scenario involves a web-based wizard which allows users to specify particular querying parameters and then save them for reference later such that time-based comparisons are facilitated with minimal user training.;0
Metadata database Implement a database of STEWARDS metadata elements.;1
The database will provide browse and query functionality.;1
Where there is an exception, the software/hardware requirement should be specified for a particular application.;1
Users whose computing environment precludes downloading the data Via the intemet will have the opportunity to acquire data, reports, model results and other STEWARDS information Via alternative media.;1
The potential for needing Gigabytes of data storage capacity is also in the realm of possibilities.;0
Further requirements gathering is needed to get real-world estimates of such data storage needs.;0
Further, secure, off?site storage will be performed on a weekly basis with 24-hour retrieval times.;1
1: Load Balancing - Application Servers and Database servers must be load balanced at the application level to ensure maximum stability and availability.;1
Specific scenarios, such as fail-over versus session-managed load balancing need to be addressed in the functional requirements speci?cation.;0
HR?2.4: The system will use, where appropriate, the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD.;1
This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/Tl connection at the server/hosting site, network servers, and network management tools.;0
Backup Software ? Data and application backups will be managed through fully supported backup software solutions.;1
HTTP and GIS Server Applications ? As the Web will be the primary delivery protocol for the application, HTTP and related GIS server applications will be required to support system functionality.;1
Web Browsers and Browser Plug-ins ? In support of External Interface requirements, commonly supported web browsers will be used to implement a thin-client architecture.;1
The use of Browser plug-ins will be judiciously restricted on an as-needed basis.;1
Email Services? As a secondary delivery protocol for alerts, data, and other information from the system, email server applications will be required to support system functionality.;1
SR?6: The system will use, where appropriate, the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO.;1
This includes, but is not limited to, MS AS#P/Java Scripts, Cll/Cll, MS SQL server and 118, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, Cll/C ?MySQL server, and Apache server.;0
3.6 Data migration to and retrieval from STEWARDS Data will be subject to quality assurance prior to either initial or recurring uploading to STEWARDS.;0
Initial population of STEWARDS will require that transition filters be developed jointly between the STEWARDS team and the individual watersheds.;1
These filters will provide the same function for recurring, probably annual, uploads.;1
3.6.1 Quality Assurance Local watershed staff will be responsible for performing necessary quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures prior to data being uploaded to the STEWARDS database.;0
Measurement methods and QA/QC procedures established by the CEAP Quality Assurance Team will be used by local data producers and recorded in the data provided to STEWARDS.;1
The purpose of quality assurance is intended to provide added assurance of data integrity.;0
Quality assurance checking will be carried out at two different levels ? local site level and central site level.;0
First, the guidelines for quality assurance, including parameter-specific ranges, threshold values, quality ?ags etc., will be determined.;0
Quality assurance checking at the local sites may be performed before or during the standard exchange file conversion phase.;0
A general quality assurance checking, not as specific as at the local sites, will be carried out during the data uploading stage.;0
3.6.2 Populating data Basic information regarding individual watersheds will be made available to STEWARDS by local watershed sites.;1
"Basic information may include spatial data in a GIS-compatible format; descriptive data about stations, instruments, methods, or procedures; reports; modeling results, and other data.";1
Data will be reformatted to be compatible with the STEWARDS data schema and CEAP modeling requirements.;1
Watershed data to be used in modeling that does not conform to model requirements will be processed in STEWARDS for inclusion in the STEWARDS databases.;1
In this manner, all the data files from the local sites will have consistent formats when they are stored in the central site.;1
Requests will initiate from the central system per schedule negotiated with individual watersheds.;1
Compliance by watershed staff is understood to be expected per obligations under CEAP watershed project plans reVised to accommodate the CEAP project plan objective 1.;1
3.6.4 Data derivation/aggregation The central database will allow users to access the data of individual watersheds, sub-watersheds on a station-by-station basis, or a collection of stations if the entire dataset is desired.;1
Multiple levels of data aggregation of time-series data (daily, monthly, or yearly) will be supported.;1
External Interface Requirements 4.1 User Interfaces The user interface will be simple and consistent, using terminology commonly understood by the intended users of the system.;1
The system will have a simple interface, consistent with industry standard interfaces, to eliminate the need for user training of infrequent users.;1
The STEWARDS team will evaluate the user interface of similar systems and apply appropriately.;1
4.2 Hardware Interfaces No extra hardware interfaces are needed.;1
The system will use the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD.;1
This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/Tl connection at the server/hosting site, network servers, and network management tools.;1
This system will include a warning message when a low transmission speed is detected, and a non-graphical interface option will be available.;1
System Requirements Speci?cation for S T E WARDS Page 12 4.3 Software Interfaces The system will use the standard software resgurces provided by the ARS OCIO.;1
This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C , MS SQL server and 118, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, Cll/Cll? MySQL server, and Apache server.;1
4.4 Communications Interfaces The system will use the communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO.;1
This includes, but is not limited to, HTTP protocol for communication with the web browser and the web server and TCP/IP network protocol with HTTP protocol.;1
Other Nonfunctional Requirements 5.1 Performance Requirements PR?l: Response time: The data system shall show no Visible deterioration in response time as the number of persons increases.;1
Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few seconds or less.;1
Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.;1
If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to adVise the user that the target response time cannot be met.;1
In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data.;1
PR?2: Loading speed: The data system shall load as quickly as comparable productivity tools on whatever environment it is running in.;1
5.2 Safety Requirements Data on the server should be protected from power loss but data in transit from server to requester could be lost.;1
Given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system, rather than expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated.;1
5.3 Security Requirements STEWARDS will have reasonable controls consistent with ARS OCIO practices, in compliance with agency, Dept and Govt regulations.;1
STEWARDS security requirements will have four primary components.;1
They are authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.;1
SCR?l : Authentication STEWARDS will follow industry best practices for authentication, using single-sign?on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication.;1
Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they are.;1
This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated.;0
This is primarily done through userids and passwords.;0
SCR?2: Confidentiality System Requirements Speci?cation for S T E WARDS Page 13 Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately.;0
Any data that should be Viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features.;1
SCR?3: Data Integrity The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product.;1
Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system.;1
Therefore, extensive data validation and reView will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process.;1
The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.;1
SCR?4: Availability The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability.;0
The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not less than 50% of working hours in any week).;1
For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components.;1
Intentional ?denial of service attacks? is not foreseen as a significant concern.;0
5.4 Software Quality Attributes SQ-l: Portability This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments.;1
SQ-2: Adaptability Implementation of the application software/code and design of database stmcture should be ?exible enough for the necessary change in the later phase.;1
SQ-3: Availability Availability is defined here to mean the ability to use the system during its intended period of operation as defined in SCR?4 above.;1

Through a user case survey and a logical analysis of user?s expectations and system functionalities, the system components for STEWARDS are identified (Fig.;1
System design provides a detailed description for each identified component and produces a physical data system design (with documentation) that allow the system developers to constmct each component (layer) accordingly.;0
At the end of the system design phase, hardware, software tools and skill requirements, and other resources will be identi?ed and a system developer team/plan will be drawn.;0
System Design Methodology: The system design process can be diVided into three main phases: conceptual system design, logical system design, and physical system design.;0
In this appendix, only conceptual system design and logical system design for STEWARDS are documented.;0
Physical system design (how the logical stmcture of STEWARDS will be implemented) is still in a planning stage and will be described later.;0
Physical design, which involves producing a description of the implementation of logical system design, will be tailored to STEWARDS and all physical considerations (including tools/software such as Microsoft SQL server, Oracle SQL server etc.);0
Conceptual System Design: Build a conceptual data system for STEWARDS As depicted in the conceptual model of STEWARDS (Fig.;0
The database design and interface/application design parallel each other within the system development process.;0
The total number of system components will depend on the level of detail.;0
For example, the data component of STEWARDS can be further identified as watershed climate, image, soils, management, pollutant source, hydrology, socio-economic, water quality data, data search, data downloads etc (Fig.;0
Description for hardware infrastructure design will be provided separately.;0
Logical System Design: Build and validate the logical data system for STEWARDS During the logical system design phase, a logical data system (all system components and their relationships) will be constmcted and validated.;0
In other words, the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams for measurement data and user graphic interfaces (UGIs) to connect all components will be developed.;0
For example, an entity-relationship diagram for measured climate data at South Fork watershed, Iowa, is given in Fig.;0
The actual (basic) climate data is also an entity and has its own table (a table with System Requirements Speci?cation for S T E WARDS Page I 9 yellow background in Fig.;0
F3 also shows the relationships between tables.;0
The latter is the basic data table where climate data are stored.;0
Note that the characteristics (topic) of a theme (e.g.;0
F3 become the ?elds (min_temperature, max_temperature, etc.).;0
The data descriptors for the basic data table and supporting tables are shown in Tables F1 and F2 respectively.;0
It provides a skeleton of system interface design.;0
Three major system application components are identified: overview/summary, system search, and data access/Visualization/downloads.;0
Purpose This document aims at capturing the complete software requirements for the system.;0
It fully describes the external behaviour of the application(s) or subsystem(s) identified.;0
It also describes non?functional requirements, design constraints and other factors necessary to provide a complete and comprehensive description of the requirements for the software.;0
The current version of this document is the one released at end of iteration C1.;0
Structure of the The first chapter describes the functional and non?functional requirements.;0
The document second chapter describes the use?case model comprehensively, in terms of how the model is structured into packages and what use cases and actors are in the model.;0
"A requirement is defined as ""a condition or capability to which a system must conform"".";0
Functional requirements specify actions that a system must be able to perform, without taking physical constraints into consideration.;0
These are often best described in a use?case model and in use cases.;0
Functional requirements thus specify the input and output behaviour of a system.;0
Requirements that are not functional are sometimes called non-functional requirements.;0
Many requirements are non?functional, and describe only attributes of the system or attributes of the system environment.;0
There are a many different kinds of requirements.;0
One way of categorizing them is described as the FURPS+ model [GRA92], using the acronym FURPS to describe the major categories of requirements with subcategories as shown below.;0
A design requirement, often called a design constraint, specifies or constrains the design of a system.;0
This section should indicate any design constraints on the system being built.;0
Design constraints represent design decisions that have been mandated and must be adhered to.;0
Examples include software languages, software process requirements, prescribed use of developmental tools, architectural and design constraints, purchased components, class libraries, etc.;0

Contents This chapter contains the following topics: A use?case model is a model of the system's intended functions and its surroundings.;0
It serves as a contract between the customer, the users and the system developers on the functionality of the system, which allows : I Customers and users to validate that the system will become what they expected.;0
I System developers to build what is expected.;0
The same use?case model is used in system analysis, design, implementation, and testing.;0
The use?case model consists of use cases and actors.;0
An actor defines a coherent set of roles that users of the system can play when interacting with it.;0
A user can either be an individual or an external system.;0
A use case defines a set of use?case instances, where each instance is a sequence of actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular actor.;0
Each use case in the model is described in detail, showing step?by?step how the system interacts with the actors, and what the system does in the use case.;0
Use cases function as a unifying thread throughout the software lifecycle.;0
hacking The TCN Adminislrelur isnul relaled m any 01A and wurksfurlhe Ec urTmsIed Third Parly company huding and managing Ihe TACHOneI services Introduction This map describes the list of identified use cases.;0
For clarity reasons, use cases are organized as packages.;0
The description of each of the use cases packages is given in the next sections.;0
Use Case 01 ? Check driver(s)? issued cards Description This use case consists of processing a request for checking driver?s issued card coming from a Card Issuing Authority (CIA).;0
Such request could contain the data for a single driver (online mode) or several drivers (batch mode).;0
This use case is also used by enforcers (on behalf of CIA ? as TACHOnet only sees CIA as SPOC) during road checks.;0
Basic flow The basic flow consists of the following steps: Step Action 1 TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request as?is in its tracking database.;0
2 TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid (TCNRefId).;0
5 For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as?is in its tracking database and validates its syntax.;0
If it is valid, TACHOnet stores the response data (linked to the TCN refid) in the database (for later building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send when all responses are received or when the timeout is reached).;0
It is also useful for enforcement authorities during road?checks where workshop could also be checked (beside driver cards).;0
The checked card is identified by its card number and its issuing Member State code.;0
As an issued card must be unique, it should only exist in a single CIA data store (the CIA having issued the card).;1
Basic flow The basic flow consists of the following steps: Step Action 1 TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request as?is in its tracking database.;0
2 TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid (TCNRefId).;0
3 TACHOnet will build as many new requests as issuing Member State codes identified in the original request.;0
TACHOnet figures out the target issuing Member State(s) from the issuing Member State code given for each to?be?checked card.;0
Every new request only contains card number(s) issued by a particular Member State.;1
4 For each identified issuing Member State(s), TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the new request, sends it to it and waits for receiving the response.;1
5 For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as?is in its tracking database and validates its syntax.;1
If it?s valid, TACHOnet stores the response message (linked to the TCNRede) in the database (for later building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send when all responses are received or when the timeout is reached).;1
6 When all responses are received or when the timeout is reached, TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the consolidated response (from the responses received so far), and sends it to the original caller.;1
Alternate flows The same alternate flows as described for UC?Ol (page 23) may exist depending on the result of some events/actions of the basic flow.;1
Afterwards, if still unsuccessful, it will record a ?Server Error? status code.;1
TCN will not check the validity of the state transition declared in this transaction (e.g.;1
It's up the MS responsibility to check the validity of such state transition (and return a ModStatusCode=CardStatuslnvalid in the XML response message).;0
Table 1 ? New card status Basic flow The basic flow consists of the following steps: Step Action 1 TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request as?is in its tracking database.;0
2 TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid (TCNRede).;1
3 TACHOnet will build as many new requests as issuing Member State codes identified in the original request.;1
TACHOnet figures out the target issuing Member States based on the CIA country code given in the original request.;1
Every new request only contains card number(s) issued by a particular Member State.;1
4 For each identified issuing Member State(s), TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the new request, sends it to the Member State and waits for receiving the response.;1
If it?s valid, TACHOnet stores the response message (linked to the TCNRede) in the database (for later building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send when all responses are received or when the timeout is reached).;1
6 When all responses are received or when the timeout is reached, TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the consolidated response (from the responses received so far), and sends it to the original caller.;1
Alternate flows The same alternate flows as described for UC?Ol (page 23) may exist depending on the result of some events/actions of the basic flow.;0
Pre-conditions 0 The CIA sending the declaration must be defined in TACHOnet 0 The CIA sending the declaration must send its request using the TACHOnet required request format (see below).;1
0 The CIA sending the declaration must have first sent a request for checking the card number for which status modification is required.;1
Post-conditions 0 The CIA sending the declaration has received a response to its request.;0
0 The CIA having issued the card has received the request and processed it.;0
TACHOnet figures out the issuing Member State code(s) based on the driving license issuing nation (and not the card issuing Member State code) given for each sub request.;1
Every new request only contains card and driving license number(s) issued by a particular Member State.;1
For each identified issuing Member State(s), TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the new request, sends it to the Member State and waits for receiving the response.;1
For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as?is in its tracking database and validates its syntax.;1
If it?s valid, TACHOnet stores the response message (linked to the TCNRefId) in the database (for later building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send when all responses are received or when the timeout is reached).;1
When all responses are received or when the timeout is reached, TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the consolidated response (from the responses received so far), and sends it to the original caller.;1
Alternate flows The same alternate flows as described for UC?Ol (page 23) may exist depending on the result of some events/actions of the basic flow.;0
The Member State CIAs should call upon this service when issuing a new card to get the computed search keys of the driver? s surname and first names, so to store them in their local data store.;1
When a Member State CIA will receive a TACHOnet request for checking driver?s issued card, it should use the search keys given in the request to search against their local data store (along with the given driver?s birth date).;1
It?s therefore of major importance to use a common algorithm and to store computed search keys in the local data store.;1
Nevertheless, Member States are free to use their own Phonetic algorithm (if existing like in Germany).;1
In such a case, it?s the Member State responsibility to compute the search keys based on the given driver? s surname and first of the first names.;1
The caller must provide the mandatory input parameters.;1
The caller has received the computed search keys (or a negative error code).;1
), TACHOnet returns a negative status code to the request.;1
Special 0 This service should ideally be implemented as a synchronous Web Service.;1
0 A downloadable version of this web service should also be made available (.NET and Java) to enable some Member States to install and use it locally.;1
Pre-conditions The caller must provide the mandatory input parameters.;1
Post-conditions The caller has received the computed search keys (or a negative error code).;0

The goal of the Swift mission is to determine the Oiigin 0f Gamma?Ray Bursts (GRBs) and to exploit data from these bursts to probe the early universe.;1
Swift instrumentation Will exploit newly discovered GRB afterglow characteiistics to make a comprehensive study of approximately 1000 bursts over its planned three-year mission.;1
Swift Will determine the Oiigin 0f GRBs, reveal how GRB blast waves interact With surroundings, and identify different classes of bursts and associated physical processes.;1
To accomplish these mission goals, Swift employs three semi-autonomous science instruments.;0
The Burst AleIt Telescope (BAT) is a Wide-angle X-ray telescope that detects GRBs.;0
On detection, the spacecraft slews in the direction of the GRB, bringing it into the View of two narrow-?eld telescopes for higher?resolution multi-Wavelength observation.;0
The narrow-?eld telescopes are the X-Ray Telescope (XRT), and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT).;0
The XRT electronics is split into two parts: the XRT Electronics Package (XEP), and the Camera Head.;0
The Relay board also has the Digital- t0-Ana10g Conveiters (DACs) for controlling the CCD voltages.;0
0 The Sequencer board Which uses an AD21020 microprocessor to generate the CCD clock waveforms 0 The Housekeeping board that reads voltages, temperatures, and pressure.;0

2 Chg. 0 Software Requirements Speci?cation Page 2 0 The Engineeiing Units (EU) Will also have an Ethernet board for software development, but the Flight Units (FU) Will not.;0
A one-meter maximum length cable electrically connects the XEP and Camera Head.;0
The XRT Interface Control Document (Pennsylvania State University [PSU] document # XRT-PSU-018) describes the interface between these two components.;0
The major component of the XRT?s electronics is the CCD camera.;0
The CCD camera collects science data in the form of images, light curves, photon-counts, and spectral data.;1
The CCD camera has three main modes of operation and up to sixty-four modes total.;1
The Camera Head is mounted on the telescope tube and is comprised of a CCD and two Video preampli?ers.;1
The CCD itself has an image section, a store section, and two readout registers With Video outputs.;1
There are four synchronized three-phase clocks that shift the pixel rows in the image and store sections and shift the individual pixels in the two readout registers.;1
The Clock Sequencer in the XEP generates these clocks.;0
Since the readout registers are compiised of split-pixels, the readout registers have to be clocked twice (double-clocked) to shift out one pixel.;1
The readout registers Will be double-clocked an extra 30 times (overclocks) to produce an output row length of 640 pixels.;1
The clockng of an empty output register produces overclocked pixels that are used to determine system noise information.;1
To transfer an image from the Image Section to the Store Section, the Image Section and Store Section three-phase clocks must be clocked simultaneously 602 times.;0
The Clock Sequencer can be programmed With up to 64 waveform patterns Which corresponds to the 64 modes of operation previously mentioned.;1
The CCD is cooled by a TEC.;1
The CCD?s temperature is closed-loop controlled by the FSW.;0
Telecommands Will control the temperature setpoint, the ramp rate, and the mode 7 open or closed loop.;1
A digital potentiometer With 100 Wiper tap points Will control the temperature setpoint.;1
Two digital logic signals Will control the Wiper position: the up/down input and the clock input.;1
1.4Power The XRT is powered by the S/C by two 28VDC power buses.;1
They are the Operational Power Bus (OPB) and the Survival Power Bus (SPB).;1
Duiing normal operation, both buses are on.;0
If the XRT fails to communicate to the S/C, the S/C Will turn off the XRT?s OPB, thereby deactivating the XEP.;0
The hardware-reset function is exercised Southwest Research Institute 04121-XCPSRS-01 XRT Control Processor April 23, 2001 Rev.;0
The SPB supplies power to heaters that prevent the XRT from being damaged by low temperatures.;1
The S/C may switch off the SPB, but it Will only do this in an emergency condition.;1
The OPB is dual redundant, and the SPB is single string.;1
1.5Con1munications Network The XRT communicates to the S/C Via a dual redundant MIL-STD?1553B seIial interface.;0
The BAT, UVOT, XRT, two Star Trackers, and the S/C are all networked together on the 1553 bus.;0
The TAM consists of a point source of light that is re?ected by mirrors across the length of the telescope tube to a CCD camera.;1
The change in the telescope?s alignment is propottional to the change in the position of the point source of light shining on the CCD?s pixel array.;0
To obtain a resolution better than the pixel size, a centroid algorithm Will be utilized.;0
The TAM receives power from the XEP and delivers image data through an RS-422 serial interface.;1
The TAM power can be turned on or off by a telecommand.;1
1.1.8Doors and Sun Shutter The XRT has two doors: a telescope tube door and a camera door.;1
The telescope tube door is controlled by the S/C.;1
The camera door is controlled by circuitry in the XEP.;1
"Once opened, the camera door cannot be closed; therefore, it is impottant that the door is not inadveItently opened.";0
The Sun Shutter is powered by the SPB and has its own solar panel for backup power.;1
It is automatically opened and closed by a photosensor but can be overridden by a telecommand.;1
1.9Heaters The telescope tube has 36 heater groups.;0
Each heater group is closed-loop controlled by the FSW With the temperature set point and hysteresis controlled by a telecommand.;0
These controllers are simple on-off type With hysteresis.;0
The Mirror Baf?e has three heater groups: Survival, Control 1, and Control 2.;0
The Survival Heaters are powered and controlled by the Spacecraft Bus.;0
The Control Heaters are closed-loop controlled by the FSW With a temperature set point controlled by a telecommand.;0
The Control Heaters Will be diiven by solid state relays to allow for the numerous on-off cycles that Will be required to regulate the temperature.;0
The XRT Thermal Design Speci?cation (PSU document # XRT-PSU-012) desCIibes the heaters in greater detail.;1

Detailed functional, performance, error recovery, and interface requirements for the identi?ed CSCs are provided in Appendix A.;0
4.1System Context From a system (observatory) perspective, the FSW interfaces with the Spacecraft Control Unit (SCU) Via the MIL- STD?1553B bus and the one pulse per second (1PPS) interface.;0
The interfaces of the FSW in this context are illustrated in the following ?gure.;0
From a XCP hardware interface perspective, the FSW executes on the XCP, stores and retrieves data from XCP Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), and communicates with the Spacecraft using the MIL-STD?1553B Bus.;0
The MIL-STD?1553B and Camera Head Interfaces are contained on the XRT Communications Module (XCM).;0
The interfaces of the FSW in this context are illustrated in the following ?gure.;0
The following sections describe the operational concepts of the FSW, including its functions, interfaces, performance characteristics, error detection, reporting and recovery mechanisms, and ground systems concepts.;0
4.2. lFunctions The FSW has the following primary functions: 0 Process science data from the camera and relay it to the Spacecraft Control Unit (SCU) in the form of CCSDS Source Packets.;1
0 Receive commands from the SCU that establish the current instrument state and camera mode.;1
0 Transmit detailed housekeeping data to the SCU in the form of CCSDS Source Packets.;1
0 Receive a time message from the SCU and synchronize the XCP local copy of the spacecraft clock.;1
0 Control the heaters on the telescope tube and on the thermal baf?es.;1
4.2.20bservation Sequence The XRT supports three different, but very similar, observation sequences.;1
The three observation types are: 0 Automatic 0 Preplanned 0 Target of Opportunity Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a detailed ?owchart for the observation types.;1
The sequence shown in the ?gures assumes the software is in automatic mode and not presently engaged in performing an observation.;0
The sequence starts when a SISCATTITUDE message is received with the IS7SETTLED indication set to false.;1
The message also indicates 1S71N7107ARCMIN, which is true when the S/C is within ten arc minutes of the target position.;1
When the distance remaining to slew is greater than ten arc minutes, the S/C begins the ?rst of up to three activities that precede an observation.;1
Each activity is initiated when the distance remaining is greater than ten arc minutes and the previous activity is complete.;1
One frame is acquired for the row bias map.;0
Once the frame has been acquired, the software recalculates and stores the updated row bias map.;0
Next, the software recalculates the image bias map, if more than ten arc minutes remain to the target location.;0
The software accumulates 3-6 frames for the recalculation of the row bias map.;1
Otherwise, the eXisting image bias map is reused.;1
Finally, if the acquire raw data image ?ag is true and the distance to the target location is more than ten arc minutes, then the software acquires a single raw data image which is saved for later download to the ground.;0
At this point, the S/C has come to within ten arc minutes of the target or the observation preliminary activities are complete, and the software switches to the fast timing mode.;0
When the SISCATTITUDE message indicates that the S/C is settled, the software starts the main portion of the observation sequence.;1
The software now acquires a frame of data and begins counting the pixels above a detection threshold.;0
To be considered of interest, this count of pixels must exceed a programmable threshold.;0
If the count does not exceed the threshold, then another image is acquired and summed with the ?rst image.;0
This new image is subjected to the pixel count.;0
This process continues until the count threshold is met or the timeout period is exceeded.;0
If the timeout is exceeded, an ?XRT Centroid Error? message is transmitted to UVOT and to the ground (Via TDRSS).;1
Otherwise, when the source is detected, the software performs a centroid calculation on the image.;1
"If the centroid calculation fails, an ?XRT Centroid Error? message is sent; otherwise, an ?XRT Position? message is sent.";1
Next, the software enters the fast timing mode.;0
In this mode, the CCD reports a single value representing the entire image.;0
The CCD reports one pixel every 16 usec, or approximately 60,000 pixels/sec.;1
The software remains in this mode while the lit pixel rate exceeds 40 cps.;1
Once the count falls below 40 cps, the software switches to normal timing mode.;1
In this mode, the CCD reports one row every 5 msec.;1
Each row report sums up the CCD columns.;1
This method is used until the rate drops below 2 cps.;1
At this point, the software switches to photon counting mode.;1
In this mode, the entire image is collected and scanned for lit pixels.;1
The update rate is approximately once every 2.5 sec.;0
The observation sequence ends when the target is occulted and the S/C slews to a new target.;1
Preplanned observations differ from automatic ones in that the ?XRT Position? message is not used.;1
Processing is otherwise similar.;0
The target of opportunity observations are treated like preplanned observations from an operational point of View of the software.;0
Southwest Research Institute 04121-XCPSRS-01 XRT Control Processor April 23, 2001 Rev.;0
2 Chg. 0 Software Requirements Speci?cation Page 21 The FSW has the following states: Off, Boot, Init, Manual, Red, and Auto.;0
The following diagram illustrates these states and their transitions.;0
SWIFT XRT STATE TRANSITIONS Note, the state diagram indicates that the S/ C can only switch off the XRT?s power when the XRT is in the Boot, Init, or Manual state.;0
This is the preferred mode of operation and can only be accomplished if the S/C ?rst sends a ?Safehold Noti?cation? message to the XRT.;1
In a time critical emergency condition the S/C will turn off the power to the XRT regardless of what state it is in.;1
The following table describes the XCP states and, for each mode, indicates whether the FSW is commandable, whether the FSW produces any telemetry, and whether or not detector events are processed.;1
INIT Automatically Check CCD voltages, perform Built?In No Startup None from BOOT Test Stage 2, transition to MANUAL or Packet.;0
IDLE AUTO Commended Automatically calculate a bias map and a Yes Yes Processed from IDLE, or mean-row map each time the state is MANUAL entered, follow observation sequence.;1
MANUAL Automatically CCD is unpowered if state was entered Yes Yes May be from INIT if from INIT.;0
CCD is powered if state was processed.;1
CCD voltages entered from IDLE, AUTO, or RED.;0
lfa command is received in this state that is not a RED command, the command will be rejected and the state will tra nsition to MAN UAL.;1
XCP has multiple modes.;0
These modes are detailed in Table 2.;0

Science Data Acquisition Modes Mode and Descrip tion Entered 0n Setu p Activities and Data Prod u cts Ramp DACs possible values.;0
The purpose of the Ramp DACs Mode is to continuously ramp the CCD bias voltages through all RED Ground Command No report.;1
Used only during Integration and Test to verify CCD bias voltage circuitry before installing CCD.;1
Real-time telemetry (strip chart mode) is used to check this data.;0
4.2.3Interfaces and Performance Estimates of the maximum amount of memory required to buffer an observation were computed according to the following analyses.;0
Since in this case it is assumed that it takes the S/C 50 seconds to slew to the source, the ?uX is already at or below 4000 cps by the time the S/ C has slewed to the target and generated an XRT Position and an XRT image report.;0
Within 30 minutes, the maximum length of an observation before the target is occulted, the data rate has dropped to less than 700bps.;0
During such an observation the XRT would generate about 2.7MB of data, for an average rate of about 12kbps.;0
Table 4 shows the eXpected data that would be generated by the XRT if it could observe the burst described above for 24 continuous hours.;1
However, Southwest Research Institute 04121-XCPSRS-01 XRT Control Processor April 23, 2001 Rev.;0
Hence, the data rate of the continuous, 24-hour observation of a new burst represents the maximum data rate expected for the XRT.;0
Under this scenario, the XRT would generate about 10MB of data per day, for an average rate of about 1kbps, which is well within the 3.9kbps average rate allocated to the XRT for science telemetry.;0
Hence, under these conditions, if the amount of memory allocated for observation buffers exceeds 10MB, the XRT should easily be able to meet its allocated science telemetry rate.;1
4.2.4.1Software Con?guration Integrity The XCP maintains primary and alternate FSW con?gurations in EEPROM.;1
The primary FSW con?guration in EEPROM is software locked to be read-only.;1
The primary FSW provides MIL-STD-1553B communications with the SCU provided there are no failures.;1
The XCP bootstrap software autonomously switches to the alternate FSW con?guration in the event the primary con?guration fails to boot.;1
Problems with the FSW that are identi?ed on-orbit can be corrected by patch or by a complete software reload.;0
The FSW contains an EEPROM-resident ?le system on which an object ?le containing a software patch can be loaded.;1
This object ?le can then be dynamically loaded and linked into the active FSW.;0
Alternatively, a complete software Southwest Research Institute 04121-XCPSRS-01 XRT Control Processor April 23, 2001 Rev.;0
2 Chg. 0 Software Requirements Speci?cation Page 27 build can be loaded to the alternate FSW location in EEPROM and the XCP commanded to boot the alternate con?guration rather than the primary.;0
The EEPROM includes a section that contains the bootstrap.;0
This section of the EEPROM is software write locked prior to ?ight and includes a checksum that is compared against the stored data as part of the Built?In Tests (BIT) that are executed on system startup.;0
The DRAM includes Error Detecting and Correcting (EDAC) memory.;1
This facility stores redundant information in parallel with each memory word.;1
Whenever a memory word is read, the EDAC is checked.;1
The EDAC can detect and correct single bit errors.;1
The EDAC can detect double bit errors.;1
Both events cause an interrupt, and the software logs information about the error including the affected address and incrementing the EDAC error count.;1
Multiple bit errors (two or more) cause the software to reset the processor by discontinuing strobing of the watchdog timer, which causes the watchdog timer to reset the board when it times out.;0
A low priority software task called the Memory Scrubber runs when no other tasks are executing.;1
This task steps through DRAM and reads each location.;0
When a word is read that contains a single-bit error, this routine rewrites it to correct the problem, and the problem is logged to EEPROM through the interrupt mechanism.;1
The scrubbing process seeks to repair single bit errors before they become uncorrectable multiple bit errors.;1
Multiple bit errors uncovered by the scrubber result in a reset, even if the memory was not currently in use for processing by the FSW.;1
4.2.4.3Error Reporting Errors are reported in XCP housekeeping telemetry.;1
If an unrecoverable error occurs (such as an uncorrectable memory error), the XCP will reboot Via watchdog timer.;1
Detectable exceptions that cause a watchdog reboot are recorded to EEPROM.;1
4.2.4.4Keep Alive Messaging A heartbeat message from XRT to the SCU serves to indicate ?aliveness? of the XRT Instrument to the Spacecraft.;1
Low-level driver integration and testing is accomplished using a XCP-resident test application which exercises the hardware interfaces Via actual ?ight software drivers.;1
A Ground Support Equipment (GSE)?resident application communicates with the XCP-resident test application over an RS-232 port which is unused on ?ight.;1
The GSE- resident application commands the XCP-resident application to output or receive data on a particular hardware interface.;1
The GSE has a direct connection to each hardware interface, and stimulates or measures the interface in accordance with the command sent to the XCP.;1
Because the RS-232 port is not used on ?ight, each interface can be tested without interfering with the command-and-response communication between the XCP and GSE resident applications.;1
Simulators are used to facilitate integration and veri?cation of the FSW.;0
To contain costs and smooth integration, the external interfaces to the simulators used for integration testing and veri?cation of the FSW are the same as the ground system interfaces in the Science Mission Operations Center (SMOC).;0

1.5 Overview The remainder of this document provides a greater detail functionality and requirement of the software.;0
Section 2 desolibes product perspective, oveIall functionality, intended users, constraints and assumption of this software.;0
Section 3 provides general Use Cases and speci?c requirement of this software.;0
2 Overall Description This section provides an oveIView of the proj ect functionality and factors that affect this project and its requirements.;0
2.1 Product Perspective This project will be a fIaInework that provides reusability of agents communication .;0
It is implemented in J ava and provides the basic building blocks for building agents, conversations between agents, and the message that are passed in the conversations.;0
2.1.1 Software InteIface ? java version 1.4.0 is required to use the software.;0
2.1.2 Communication Interface ? TCP/IP is used in order to send unicast message.;0
Multicast protocol is used in order to send multicast message.;0
UDP is used in order to send broadcast message.;1
2.2 Product Functions 2.2.1 Enable agents to broadcast a message to all the agents within the same local network.;1
2.2.2 Enable agents to multicast a message to all the agents within the same multicast address.;1
2.2.3 Enable agents to unicast a message to other agents within organization.;1
2.2.4 Allow agents to choose among unicast, multicast and broadcast communication.;1
2.2.5 Allow agents to join and leave multicast group.;1
2.2.6 Provide message enc1yption and deCIyption techniques for secured communication.;1
2.2.7 Allow agents to choose to encrypt or not to encrypt message.;0
2.3 User Characteristics Users who want to implement multi? agent systems based on this framework are expected to have general knowledge of Java programming, object-on'ented programming and Multi? Agent Systems Engine eIing Methodology.;1
2.4.1 Reliable message deliver ? multicast/broadcast packets are delivered with best effort.;1
Thus, a packet may be delivered to all speci?ed agents or none.;0
2.4.2 Security ? we provide some basic mechanisms for secu1ity such as message enCIyption.;0
However, there is no guaIantee that the others cannot decrypt the enc1ypted messages.;1
2.4.3 Multicast Protocol ? in order to send multicast message, netw01k environment such as router, netw01k card and operating systems must support multicast protocol.;1
2.4.4 Broadcast Message ? in many network, only system administrator is allowed to send broadcast message.;0
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies;0
.2.5.1 We assume that each agent knows the address of destinating agents in order to send unicast message.;0
2.5.2 We assume that each agent has enough knowledge to decide the best way to communicate with the other agents.;0
2.5.3 In the case of using secured multicast communication, we assume that there is an agent whom each agent can request for the same enc1yption and deCIyption key.;1
This agent should maintain a list of agents who are allowed to get the keys.;0
2.5.4 We assume that each agent knows the multicast address in order to send multicast message.;0
3 Specific Requirements This section provides all of the project requirements in detail.;0
Message is enCIypted or Message is not enc1ypted.;1
An agent sends notify to join/leave multicast group.;0
Message is deCIypted only if Message is enc1ypted.;0
For example, Agent_B and Agent_D belong to the same group, and then Agent_B wants to leave the group and Agent_A wants to join the group.;1
In this situation, when reorganization occurs, Agent_A who is previously not pan of the group may send notify message to join the group, and Agent_B who is previously part of the group, may send notify message to leave the group.;0
For instance, Agent_B suffers a failure in one of its capabilities and does not want to receive any further message from the group.;1
Agent_A who may have capability to substitute Agent_B is needed to be pan of the group.;1
This involves sending notify of join and leave the group.;0
Message is encrypted or Message is not encrypted.;0
An agent sends multicast message to the group (multicast address).;0
Other agents in the group receive message.;1
Message 1s decrypted only if Message 1s encrypted I11 this situation, Agent_ A wants to send a message to everyone within the group, assuming that Agent_A, Agent_B and Agent_C subscribe to the same multicast address.;0
This involves the multicast communication since other agents who do not belong to the group carmot receive this message.;1
For instance, an agent may want to inform everyone in the group when the assigned tasks are completed.;0
This is more effective than in unicast communication since only one copy is sent.;0
Also, using biddmgmarket-based protocols ?t well with this kind of communication An agent may request a bid from other agents for doing some tasks.;0
An agent sends message to everyone in the same local network.;0
Other agent in the same local network receive message.;0
In this situation, Agent_A wants to send a message to everyone within the same local network that agent A belongs to.;0
This involves the broadcast communication since any agent in the same local network as Agent_A can receive this message.;0
For instance, when a new agent who does not previously exist in that local network wants to armounce the existence to other agents.;0

As such D8 is a so-called common deliverable, beyond workpackage borders.;0
There is no ambition to strive for completeness in this document.;0
All BEYOND project members have been approached and partners themselves have made a selection of appropriate projects that could support the goal ofthis deliverable.;0
It was decided that a domain-oriented approach provides a comprehensive structure for this deliverable.;0
It supports the placement of the individual projects in their context, and allows key aspects of the involved workpackages (multimodality, adaptivity, simulation and usability) to be emphasized.;1
Therefore, the other partners had to find a way to overcome this problem.;0
One consequence is that most of the contributing partners devoted resources to usability engineering activities, as reported in this deliverable.;0
Also, reconsidering the purpose of this deliverable D8 and devoting some time to the usability issues has delayed this deliverable.;0
The contributions of the indivual project are ordered according to their application domain.;0
Finally, project-wide conclusions concerning the evolution from the first to the second milestone are formulated.;0
The purpose and approach of D8 has been agreed upon during the team meeting in Delft (NI), November 2000.;0
The following arguments contributed to the de?nition of D8, as it is currently presented.;0
"D8, ?Functional Specification and Architecture?, can to some extent be considered as a second iteration on D2 ""Requirements and Usability Methodology"".";0
The rationale behind this conclusion is as follows.;0
"After describing ""key concepts"" in deliverable D1, the BEYOND partners have contributed to D2, in which the requirements have been detailed and the usability methodology has been described.";0
Most of the BEYOND partners planned to have a first prototype at the time of the ?rst milestone (after one year of research in the consortium).;1
This is in particular the case for the partners that are directly active in one of the application domains (Public domain, Home domain, Vetronics domain, Avionics domain).;0
Consequently, the requirements stated in D2 are considered as a kind of checklist for the first prototype.;1
Based on the lessons learnt from the first prototype, ideas for the second prototype have been collected.;1
It seems acceptable that the relation D2?milestone 1/prototype 1 is the same as D8-milestone 2/prototype 2.;1
This as opposed to the realization of new prototypes during the second half ofthe project period.;1
As a result it was decided that a domain-oriented approach provides a comprehensive structure for this deliverable.;0
It supports the placement of the individual projects in their context, and allows key aspects of the involved workpackages (multimodality, adaptivity, simulation and usability) to be emphasized.;0
However, we opted to let the workpackages take part through projects in application domains in order to obtain a coherent and comprehensive report.;1
It should be emphasized (and it should be obvious after reading this deliverable) that the key aspects multimodality, adaptivity, simulation and usability are independent variables.;1
They are different dimensions along which the Uls are investigated, but they have nothing to do with the order in which the projects are listed.;1
The level to which these aspects have been addressed in the projects differs considerably.;0
Also, there are sections on architectural issues.;0
It has to be explicitly stated that due to uncertainties in the German funding situation, the consortium lacked the experienced partners for a separate usability workpackage.;0
Therefore, the other partners had to find a way to overcome this problem.;0
One consequence is that most of the contributing partners devoted resources to usability engineering activities, as reported in this deliverable.;0
The above mentioned relation between deliverables D1 (key concepts), D2 (requirements) and D8 (functional specifications) is applicable for all the listed projects.;0
D1, D2 and D8 are all common deliverables.;1
Besides this, there are relations with other deliverables that are the result of particular workpackages.;1
For instance, D3 ?Common Adaptivity Reference Framework? from WP2 comes into play in the adaptivity and/or architectural sections of this document.;0
This illustrates that the migration from the first to the second prototype takes into account adaptivity issues, possibly inspired by the cooperation in the context of the adaptivity framework.;1
Similar relations can be found with regard to multimodality and simulation.;1
It is likely that the relationship also extends to future deliverables, intended to provide even more detail when we progress towards milestone 2.;0
Finally, project-wide conclusions concerning the evolution from the first to the second milestone are formulated.;0
APC (apc interactive solutions AG) is working on the development of information networks, terminals and kiosk solutions to address people's needs for information in public space.;0
The core component in this project is the information terminal which is called accesspoint.;1
It resembles the interface between users and the network which transports and provides context sensitive information.;0
The accesspoint is higly multimodal and provides a good basis for adaptive services.;1
APC has devoted part of its development to user interface design.;0
Many features have been implemented in a first multimodal Accesspoint prototype.;0
This is considered to be crucial not only for the accesspoint services but the acceptance of the whole system where essential functionalities are speech controlled dialogs.;0
The second prototype will follow and offer adaptive features as well.;1
It will enable enhanced understanding of voice commands and beter dialog design will be an important step towards natural language understanding.;0
Project Status During the first year, comprehensive analysis and functional specifications have culminated into the first multi-modal prototype accesspoint.;1
Its basic technological implementation has been tested during operations in numerous public space applications as a geographical information system and marketing support media among many others.;0
During the second year, development of modular component based modules will address the lack of functionality and interoperability that are currently missing.;0
Goals for the second prototype are guidelines for basic user interface design and the simulation of a sample application.;0
Another focus is to comply with open architecture standards and maintain accessibility of web-hosted data.;1
Methods and results concerning usability As indicated in the project status, usability data has been acquired by log file analysis and video surveillance of user sessions.;1
Furthermore, users have been asked to participate in opinion polls and fill in questionnaires.;1
Pre-evaluation of the user interface has been carried out together with design experts by APC corporate partners.;0
Results were mostly focused on acceptance of the system in public space, and address the design of the solid, speech and graphical user interface.;0
It has been found that a major issue in the design of the solid user interface is ergonomics.;0
The most important requirement is the stability of the system on a high-Ievel user application level, which is a consequence of the availability of basic network and terminal functionality.;1
System failures caused by user operation or network malfunctions have to be avoided.;1
Dead ends in dialogs have to be addressed by a special help system and contextual understanding has to be provided.;1
The system must guide users throughout the interaction process quickly and effectively and it has to be designed to avoid cognitive overloads caused by information overflow.;0
The accesspoint has to be controllable through different modalities.;0
A switch between modalities must not affect the system operations, consequently there should be no need to re-initiate the dialog status.;0
Likewise, it should be possible to switch the current context without loosing perspective in case the system does not estimate the context properly.;0
General changing requirements and extensions There is an urgent need for extensibility of the software system.;0
The monolithic implementation which is used at the moment does not support modelling of upcoming functionality requests and it is very dif?cult to maintain and extend.;0
Although the ?rst prototype complies with the specified functionality we have decided to re-implement it from scratch and carefully design all application interfaces for process communications.;0
Better development tools to handle the speech system on an abstract level are required to improve the process of extending its rule database.;0
For better extensibility, context engines need to be implemented rather than interfaces and the method of choice are neural networks.;0
As for training purposes new tools are needed and should be able to derive input from rule databases which are used at the moment.;0
Usability related specifications There are two major aspects which are of vital importance for the acceptance of the terminal in public space applications.;0
Firstly the solid user interface requires high standards in ergonomics and robustness.;0
"Secondly the system needs to have a ?subtle notion"" of its services to guide users quickly and effectively.";1
It must be self explicable and understand users' needs.;1
It must also be able to handle context specific dialogs.;1
Dialogs which it doesn't understand clearly should be handled properly to limit user frustration.;1
Context switches must be supported at any state of the session and the system should offer alternatives and rank them by guessing its likelyhood.;0
The graphical and speech user interface need to complement each other.;0
They represent input and output channels and provide access to the state of the context BEYOND Public Deliverable 8 Functional Specifications and Architecture 9 February 2001 ITEA 99002 BEYOND engine.;0
The information flow must be compatible with average user capabilities to avoid cognitive overload.;1
The graphical user interface model presents information in an abstract two dimensional way and supports virtual characters.;0
Further points address training of the context engine of which some have already been mentioned above.;0
Adaptivity related specifications The following adaptivity specifications are limited to single user sessions.;0
It is assumed that multiple user sessions are not very likely to occur in public space applications.;0
A general single user session occurs when one person in front of the terminal interacts with the system.;1
An onlooker, or person inside the interaction area of the terminal is already considered to be a user.;0
"Some adaptivity related speci?cations are partly indicated in section ?Usability related specifications"" above.";0
Contextual understanding is an example and support of context switches without explicit requests are another.;0
The interaction process should be as natural as possible and the development should ultimatly enable natural language understanding.;0
every single user is understood instantly irrelevant of age, gender or other distinct characteristics.;0
Multimodality related specifications The terminal is designed to support classical input-output channels like typing or reading, and complement them with speech and visual capabilities.;0
Except for high level features, most of the above mentioned adaptivity specifications primarily rely on multimodality related features.;1
Visual and audio surveillance enable user detection and language understanding through face and speech recognition.;0
At the moment, higher level functions and more powerful features for enhanced sensing can be implemented by combining speech and visual information.;1
Mode switches which are not initiated by the system are only possible through input channels.;1
Output presentation is determined by the system and the user has no direct influence in this case.;1
If desired the user can override default settings, but because of privacy issues, certain output channels are preferred.;0
Simulation related specifications Certain new usage scenarios require extended functionality which has not been implemented yet.;1
The system functionality should be extensible and able to be integrated into the simulation environment to interface existing and new features at the same time.;0
To describe the newly defined specification, the simulation environment should provide an abstract high level scripting language thus providing an interpreter.;0
Architectural issues To ensure extensibility of the software system, an open architecture has been chosen.;0
All functionalities will be implemented using components or even distributed components in a client-server oriented approach.;1
Because of multimedia capabilities operating system selection is virtually limited to the MS V\?ndows based platform.;0
The implementations of the context engine with near natural language capabilities, the multiple modality support functions and the speech and graphical interfaces are heavily component based.;0
Introduction Home entertainment systems are embedded-computer systems that deliver entertainment content to consumers in their homes.;1
The home environment places special constraints on entertainment systems, such as audio-video systems.;0
The expected evolution is that home systems can adapt to suit to individual preferences, different contexts of use, and different types of content.;0
The user interfaces of adaptive home systems will have to communicate this adaptivity to the user.;0
A first step towards adaptive user interfaces is to have an easy way to create customisable or ?flexible? user interfaces.;0
Flexibility means here: adaptivity in the development phase.;0
However, the process to develop these ?exible user interfaces needs to be improved and supported by tools.;1
Currently, user interfaces are mostly specified on paper with sometimes-Iimited tool support, and it takes many man-years to develop them.;0
Prototypes or simulations, if developed well, are far more comprehensive than lots of pages of description and they allow early validation ofthe usability in a cost-effective way.;0
In the computer world, authoring tools or Rapid Application Development tools are used to prototype and build the graphical parts of an application.;1
These parts are compiled into executable code.;0
An authoring tool for the consumer world can use a similar approach as the user interface development tools in the computer world.;0
However, the consumer world has extra constraints that have to be taken into account: in particular, these are limited RAM, lack of hard disk and comparably slow processors.;0
The high level requirements forthis authoring tool are: c The authoring tool should allow easy modification of the behaviour of user interfaces.;0
0 The authoring tool should support easy development of adaptive user interfaces.;0
0 The authoring tool should allow the functional requirements speci?cation of the next generation of consumer products to be developed in a much faster and ef?cient manner.;0
BEYOND Public Deliverable 8 Functional Specifications and Architecture 14 February 2001 ITEA 99002 BEYOND The ?rst prototype of the authoring tool offers a basic functionality.;0
This functionality has been testing extensively by expert users in a pilot project.;0
Their experiences resulted in more knowledge, needed to specify new requirements.;1
In the mean time, a common reference model for adaptive systems has been developed.;1
The second prototype should offer a more extended functionality based on the new requirements and it should take into account the common reference model.;1
The aim of the two prototypes is to give us insight in the feasibility of the development of an authoring tool for user interface development of consumer products.;0
Project status In the first year of the project, we started with an early version of the first prototype and focussed on the specification of the requirements for this prototype, by doing usability tests.;0
This resulted in a list of requirements for the first prototype as described in section 5.4.1.;1
Also our contribution to the reference model for adaptivity (document D3) gave us a better insight in the domain of adaptivity.;0
In the first half of the second project-year, the ?rst prototype has been used in a pilot project, where a user interface for a speci?c consumer system, a DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) player was developed.;1
This usability testing by expert users in a real project was needed to gain better knowledge on what we expect from an authoring tool.;1
The requirements for a second prototype, speci?ed in section 5.4.1 are based on the knowledge gathered in these activities.;0
Although the ?rst prototype offered a limited functionality, it gave us the possibility to gain experience on the desired functionality of an authoring tool.;1
Our authoring tool specifically targets speci?cation, design, simulation and code generation, for the development of on-screen-based user interfaces and control of consumer products.;0
Code generation for a target platform is not yet supported.;0
The requirements ofthe ?rst prototype are described by the requirements listed below: 0 The authoring tool provides a set of standard widgets.;0
A widget is a graphical entity representing the interface between a user and the application software.;1
0 The authoring tool provides for each project a project repository containing a font definition, a colour palette, bitmap images and strings.;1
o The authoring tool allows the user to manage a palette and its colours.;1
Colours are organised in a palette.;0
o The authoring tool allows the userto import bitmaps from an external source.;1
0 The authoring tool allows the userto simulate a user interface on a PC.;1
An extensive evaluation of the ?rst prototype, by trying out the tool for the development of the on-screen-based user interface of a DVD player resulted in new requirements for a second prototype.;0
From the UI developer?s point of view, the main need was the addition of the ability to create menus in an OSD UI.;0
Besides this important user requirement, the second prototype of the tool should demonstrate code generation for a target platform, in this case the DVD player.;1
The extension - requirements for the second prototype are: c The authoring tool provides a complex widget containing a menu structure and a navigation function.;0
0 The authoring tool should provide a menu editor.;1
This menu editor allows the userto define items in a menu.;0
0 The authoring tool allows the user to generate C code for a target platform, e.g.a DVD player.;0
Usability related specifications The general requirements, listed in section 5.1, all stress the usability aspects of the tool.;0
A possible usability requirement that will be considered for future extensions is: ?the authoring tool should be able to assist the user in the authoring process by a wizar 5.4.3.;1
Adaptivity related specifications The ?rst as well as the second prototype focus on off-Iine adaptivity: a user interface developed with the tool is created, simulated and modi?ed on a PC.;0
The compiled C code can then be loaded in the target system.;1
Off-Iine adaptivity is a first step towards the development of more adaptive user interfaces.;0
We called this flexibility instead of adaptivity.;0
The tool offers the UI developer a more ?exible way of developing a UI.;0
Thus the authoring tool should be able to support specification, simulation and code generation of UI aspects related to these i/o peripherals.;0
A Multimodal user interface forthe authoring tool is a possible requirement for future versions.;0
Simulation related specification As specified in the requirements of section 5.4.1, the ?rst as well as the second prototype allow to make simulations of a user interface on a PC.;0
Simulations are a way to get early feedback on a UI that is being developed.;1
Architectural issues Until now, Philips Hasselt concentrated for the Beyond project on usability testing and on requirements speci?cation.;0
A lot of effort will be done to design the second prototype conform the requirements specified for the second prototype of the authoring tool.;0
Examples are global positioning systems in cars, trajectory guidance in busses and metro, systems allowing the monitoring ofa boat in its environment etc.;0
The environments in which they are used place special constraints on the displays of the Vetronics systems.;0
Rugged displays are needed, which satisfy specifications such as being resistant to vibrations, extremely high or low temperatures, shocks, high degree of humidity, magnetic fields etc.;0
These speci?cations must be satisfied in addition to common image speci?cations with regard to resolution, coIors etc.;1
In addition, the possibility to add both textual and graphic overlay to the displayed video is necessary to show navigation information, diagnostics etc.;0
BARCO collaborates with the LUC for the Vetronics software.;0
The first prototype of the UI-Editor was meant to perform some research about the general structure of the Editor.;1
This prototype gave us an impression of how to implement such kind of program and enabled us to learn about the do?s and don?ts in this kind of application.;0
Another important target is to get some feedback of the market about the new concept we are introducing.;0
High-Ievel requirements The previous section emphasized the fact that the Vetronics domain demands ruggedized displays.;0
In this section we will not mention general criteria for ruggedized displays, as they are well-known by BARCO from earlier developments.;1
We will rather focus on speci?c targets for BARCO and LUC in the second prototype based on the requirements of the first prototype.;1
VI?th the feedback on this first prototype we can re?ne our requirements so they actually re?ect our needs.;0
However the software part (UI-Editor and firmware support) are still in prototype phase because ofthe new approach for the UI-Editor.;0
Forthe Vetronics hardware and firmware: 0 Optimum Video performance 0 Ruggedness : Environmental Specification compliance.;1
"0 The so?ware structure of the ?rmware should be suitable for adding a ?UI- interpreter? (to interprete and visualize the UI code generated by the UI Editor; so a very important component in this project).";1
For this aspect we have chosen to add/implement a kind of virtual machine which performs the interaction between the UI-Code and the effective hardware/firmware.;1
0 The software (firmware) should be able to control all the available hardware and the hardware state should be accessible to the ?rmware and be exposed to the UI-Code.;0
Forthe User Interface Editor: 0 The UI Editor should allow ?exible creation and modi?cation of the user interface ofthe Vetronics application.;1
This must be done in an interactive and visual way.;0
0 The UI Editor should be able to communicate with the Vetronics hardware, to download the developed UI to the Vetronics system for real use.;0
This communication is done using different kinds of interfacing (Serial port, USB, FireVI?re, IrDa, CAN, ...).;1
This communication module is also needed to obtain the system configuration from the Vector Unit.;1
0 The UI Editor itself should be a powerful and user friendly tool.;1
Because we are focussing of VI?ndows-users, the VI?ndows guidelines are taken info account.;0
However, we do not want to obtain the ?Designed for Windows Label.;0
It should be compatible with the common versions of VI?ndows (98/ME/2000) and near-future versions.;0
0 The UI-Editor should be an open-application so we can add new functionality to support new hardware con?gurations.;0
To obtain this we must create an open framework on which we can PIug-In aII functionality we desire.;0
Flexibility versus Adaptivity We define flexibility here as a level of adaptivity of the system, from the point of view of the UI developer.;0
This way of working assumes that we, in a first stage, only focus BEYOND Public Deliverable 8 Functional Specifications and Architecture 20 February 2001 ITEA 99002 BEYOND on ?Off-Line Adaptivity?.;0
This means that we must develop/modify the User Interface using a separate program (UI-Editor) and download it into the system in order to use the new User Interface.;1
The adaptation takes place in between sessions with the Vetronics system.;1
Even this off-Iine adaptivity is a step fonivard in the Vetronics domain as in most cases, the UI is realized in firmware.;1
Project status During the first year of the project, a lot of analysis and research have been performed.;0
All this research resulted in the development of a first prototype.;0
This prototype was the first milestone in the BEYOND program.;0
The prototype consists of a User Interface Editor, a Vetronics system and some peripherals to try the complete system as such.;0
This expert review resulted in some kind of score by which we could validate the prototype (or reject it).;0
0 The functionality ofthe prototype is more or less what was required 0 The graphical performance could be better.;0
Some screen updates were not OK 0 A list of bugs/malfunctions has been made.;0
Most of these have already been corrected.;0
In fact, all functional requirements were fulfilled, but we noticed a major lack in the approach of the software: PIugIn-Capability.;0
"AII functional parts were statically linked to each other without any way to add additional functionality; although not without writing lots of code.";0
So, we have decided to start a new cycle with a weII-analyzed framework so we will be able to easily pIug-in new functionality onto the application.;0
Every pIug-in will then represent a piece of functional hardware.;0
As already mentioned in the project status, there has been an expert review on the first prototype.;0
The UI interpreter should interpret the downloaded UI code to navigate through the menus and perform de?ned actions.;0
This is the decision-agent we need for content prioritization.;0
User Interface Editor: System Configuration VI?zard Font authoring modalities The UI Editor should allow the user to create/modify menus.;0
Menus are in fact the combination of Overlay (OSD and Symbol Generator), HotSpot zones and Event-Action Associations.;1
The UI Editor should enable the user to associate an event to an action as defined in the previous point.;0
An event-driven approach is envisioned in the first prototype to evaluate its feasibility.;0
Hereby the VM must support this event-driven approach and act as a transparent link between the generated UI-code and the hardware.;0
BEYOND Public Deliverable 8 Functional Specifications and Architecture 25 February 2001 ITEA 99002 BEYOND o The UI Editor should also dispose of a facility to associate an event to more than one action.;0
This extension of the event-driven approach raises design issues to be tackled.;0
o In general, the UI Editor should be a user friendly and powerful development tool.;0
This requires: 0 Attention for visualization and simulation issues (WYSIVWG approach, e.g.;0
Visualization of the designed UI, menus, icons, Simulating navigation etc.).;0
0 Attention for solutions that speed up the development of the UI (e.g.;0
investigate the use of drag-and-drop tools such as in the context of action definition).;0
0 Attention for general usability issues and user interface design.;0
Our main extension of the requirements forthe UI-Editor is the PIug-In- approach of the program.;0
In order to meet this extra requirement a lot of investigation on the architecture of the UI-Editor has been done and seriously evaluated.;0
This resulted in a component?based approach where all functionality could easily be ?Plugged? into the editor.;0
As a result, we are able to add the Symbol Generator Functionality to the Editor, even with expanded possibilities like macro definition, text capability and bitmap operations.;0
All these important features exposed by the hardware will now be fully supported in the UI-Editor, which gives us expanding possibilities.;0
Usability related specifications The usability has been verified by the expert review of the first prototype.;0
Because of the variety of SW?experience and interest we covered a wide range of usability issues, from non-technical, commercial to pure technical.;1
Every member had his speci?c remarks on the software, as expected, some were more about the Look?And-Feel, and others were more technical about bugs and inconsistencies.;0
The hardware layout is always visible during development.;0
AIso derived Vetronics products, with different housing, LCD, are not covered.;0
0 Font creation/modi?cation is really easy and performing well.;0
BEYOND Public Deliverable 8 Functional Specifications and Architecture 26 February 2001 ITEA 99002 BEYOND 0 Some artifacts are noted during screen updates.;1
0 Communication ports are statically implemented into the editor.;0
o The complete UI-Editor has to be updated if modifications are made.;1
This is an anomaly when we want to give support/updates via the Internet.;1
0 Finally we concluded that the prototype met its functional requirements, but it was too static.;0
From our hardware development and customer requirements we had learned that all have very specific needs concerning not only on User Interface but also real Hardware Interfacing to several peripherals.;0
So we must be able to support this wide (and growing) range of interfacing capabilities of our Vetronics hardware in our UI-Editor as kind of PIug-Ins.;1
This will also solve our maintainability issue.;0
Adaptivity related specifications The generated User Interface is only off-Iine adaptive.;0
Which means the UI is modified on a separate computer and then reloaded into the Vector System.;0
The Vector system has some agents inside to prioritize the information available (UI- information, system status, Environment data, ...).;0
Though using off-Iine adaptivity, the running Vetronics application (based on code realized by means of the UI Editor) can demonstrate ?intelligent? behavior to some extent.;0
The User Interface has access to its own data (directly UI-related), but also to data provided by the firmware concerning the current system status and its environment.;0
As a consequence, there is a need for a kind of decision algorithm (=agent) in order to decide whether the UI is more important than the system/environment data or vice-versa, depending on the actual content.;0
This will re?ect in the information the user gets to see.;1
It is possible that in dangerous conditions the environmental data force the defined UI to be overruled by some buiIt-in UI elements (e.g.;0
The UI-Editor itself enables us to create and modify the User Interface off-Iine and then reload it.;0
In the definite program we can implement wizards in orderto guide the user through several tasks or warn him for contradictory situations.;0
These self- Iearning wizards will recognize the user?s behavior and identify occasions to interfere and help.;0
In this case, we need a kind of user pro?le and a behavior database in order to take the right decisions/predictions.;0
In this context, we will use the reference model in which we collaborated with the other members of WP2 for the Deliverable 3.;0
This reference model will be used in the agent approach of both the ?rmware and editor.;0
Although extension will be rather limited in ?rst, we want to do some research about extending its implementation in both the Firmware and UI-Editor.;0
BEYOND Public Deliverable 8 Functional Specifications and Architecture 27 February 2001 ITEA 99002 BEYOND 6.4.4.;0
Multimodality related specifications The relation of this project to multimodality is rather limited.;0
However, our Vector system should be able to communicate with all kinds of peripherals.;0
In Vetronics markets, probably due to the heavy environmental conditions (temperature, vibrations, noise, ...) we cannot really use fine multimodal devices.;0
However, auditive information is one of the most used feedback methods in train applications.;0
Also Touch Input devices are rather frequently used because they do not require additional place.;0
Currently, support for a touch screen is provided in the UI-Editor.;0
As a consequence, the Vector system does not have to be available while developing and testing the UI.;0
This is a very important demand because the systems are mostly built in into consoles where they are not easily accessible for downloading etc.;0
An important result of the simulation may be the ability to certify the generated UI for use in life critical conditions.;1
This can be achieved when using an identical Virtual Machine in both the simulator and firmware.;1
This is to be investigated after the finalization of our application and is certainly beyond the context of this BEYOND project.;0
Architectural issues Because this new approach demands flexible functionality by using PIug-Ins, we needed to redesign the framework from a static one to a component based one.;1
In order to be sure we can cover all flexibility requirements a lot of effort is now being done in the complete architectural redesign of the UI-Editor.;0
This architecture is thus considered as a very open framework (the base application) where we can easily plug in all PIug-Ins we need.;0
To accomplish this, we have chosen to use an component based approach by using the latest SW?technologies that are usable within this type of application/platform, namely COM & COM+.;0
Accident analysis has shown that 65% of all aircraft incidents are caused by human error.;1
Two kinds of human errors can be distinguished: slips and mistakes [Reason, 1987].;0
A slip occurs when the intention is right, but a deviation of that intention occurs.;0
A mistake occurs when the actions are according to the intended plan, but the plan is inadequate to achieve the intended goal.;0
It is expected that slips and mistakes in aircraft operation can be avoided by an intelligent adaptive flight deck that assists the ?ight crew in performing theirtasks.;0
An intelligent system that knows the human intentions and the actual and predicted flight status can detect slips from the intended plan.;0
Ifthe system is aware of the goals of the operation, the intelligent system can even give a recommendation to the pilot to correct for the error.;0
In most cases, mistakes are not simply due to a bad knowledge of the theory or procedure, but are rather a logical consequence of a lack of situation awareness.;0
The flight deck communicates to the pilot information about the ?ight status (flight plan, position, velocity, etc.;0
To form an internal representation of the flight situation, the crew has to integrate all this information presented to them on numerous head-down cockpit displays in different formats.;0
In addition, the auditory channel is used to present advice, warnings and alerts to the crew.;1
Especially during critical situations, where the situation awareness is of greatest importance, pilots have difficulties building up a representation of the ?ight situation.;0
At the same time, several buttons can lighten up, various alerts can be given, and information is highlighted on the display.;1
Mistakes can be prevented by assisting the pilot in building situation awareness.;0
Another contributorto the high workload during critical situations in the cockpit is the task ofdecision making.;0
Even if the flight crew is able to determine a good resolution to solve the problem, they have too little overview to optimize it.;0
An intelligent ?ight deck can help the pilot by proposing optimized alternatives out of which the pilot can choose one.;0
In such a co-operation, the pilot and intelligent ?ight deck share their knowledge and capabilities to improve the safety and efficiency of the overall system.;0
BEYOND Public Deliverable 8 Functional Specifications and Architecture 30 February 2001 ITEA 99002 BEYOND 7.1.2.;0
Levels of the adaptation process Four stages can be distinguished in the adaptation process: initiation, proposal, decision, and execution [Dieterich et al., 1993].;0
The agents performing or controlling these stages are the pilot of the automation.;1
This adaptation is contradicting with the human-centered design philosophy and seems therefore unacceptable.;0
In certain time-critical, high workload situations, however, it may be necessary or even mandatory to automatically adapt the interface to draw the crew?s attention and to allow an immediate but sound response.;0
Because the adaptation is unexpected and may cause confusion, its occurrence must be well known and trained by the cockpit crew.;1
User?controlled self-adaptation: the decision to adapt is taken by the user, while all other tasks are automated.;0
If the automation thinks that for the current situation a different presentation may be more ef?cient, it may suggest an adaptation that has to be agreed upon by the pilot.;1
 User?initiated self-adaptation: the user takes the initiative, the automation proposes, decides and executes.;0
This is in fact self-adaptation, but allowing the pilot to take the initiative.;0
 Computer?aided adaptation: on a user?s initiative, the automation proposes an adaptation, which it will execute afterthe user?s approval.;0
 Svstem-initiated adaptation: on a system?s initiative, the user proposes, decides and executes the adaptation.;0
The pilot is then informed if it seems reasonable to tailor the system.;1
Adagtation: the user performs the tasks on all stages of the adaptation.;0
The management of [company name]. has identified a potential need for re-writing its core Laboratory Information System (LIS) to improve the performance.;1

The Functional Requirements Speci?cations (FRS) report provides the detailed description of the functionalities required for the ?rst version of the CCTNS.;0
CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to 105, records room staff and Citizens within the broad crime investigation area.;0
Based on the guiding principles stated above, nine different function blocks have been identi?ed and the detailed functionality of each block was determined.;0
The functionality of the CCTNS application is focused on providing value to the police personnel, especially the of?cers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day operations of the police function.;0
Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward.;0
The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and Citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and information exchange between police and complainants.;0
Investigation After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process.;0
Prosecution Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel.;1
A designated constable from each police station constantly interfaces with the courts.;0
Search The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases.;0
Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc.;0
It also gives the user the ability to customize the results View by criminal/accused or by cases.;0
It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, RTI related etc.;0
The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange between Citizens and police units/personnel.;0
Citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police.;1
The police in turn can use it to respond to Citizens with very little turnaround time.;1
The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application.;1
It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater ef?ciency.;1
Application Configuration The Con?guration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application con?gured according to the states? requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date.;0
With a proper con?guration, information such as act and sections, state speci?c data, castes, tribes, property information etc.;0
The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A1 to A7 in separate enclo sures.;0
The non?functional requirements specify the qualitative attributes such as user?friendliness and performance of the system that are critical for the increased user?acceptance 0f the application.;0
Help Module 1 The solution should provide detailed context?sensitive help material for all the possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application.;0
2 The solution should send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) to the user if the user Chooses .;1
The solution should enable the help?desk user to View the reports on the 4. submitted defects or enhancement requests category?wise, status?wise, and age? wise.;1
5 The support solution should be accessible to the users both from within the application and also outside the application through a browser interface.;1
Audit Module An audit trail is a record of actions taken by either the user or the system triggers.;1
This includes actions taken by users or Administrators, or actions initiated automatically by the system as a result of system parameters.;0
Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track 2. events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them.;1
The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at 3' least for the life of the case to which it refers.;1
The System must be able to export audit trails for speci?ed cases (without 5. affecting the audit trail stored by the System).;1
This functionality can be used by external auditors who wish to examine or analyse system activity.;1
A user?s attempts 6. to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where Violations can validly be attempted) attempted Violations, of access control mechanisms.;0
The System should be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised by workstation and (where technically appropriate) by network address.;1
The requirements specify the requirements to control the user access to correspondences, ?les, and records and various functionalities provided within the system.;0
Access Module The System must allow the user to limit access to cases to speci?ed users or user groups.;0
The System must allow a user to be a member of more than one group.;0
The System must allow only adrnin?users to set up user pro?les and allocate users to groups.;1
The System should allow a user to stipulate which other users or groups can access cases.;1
The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users (such as access rights, security level, privileges, password allocation and management) to be made only by super?user.;1
These options are presented in order of increasing security.;1
If a user performs a quick or advanced search, the System must never include in the search result list any record which the user does not have the right to access.;0
Any access to cases, and all other activities involving the cases and related 10. documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal admissibility and to assist in data recovery.;0
All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them.;0
The System must be able to display several entities (cases, suspects) simultaneously.;0
The interfaces must be made customizable or user?con?gurable to the extent 4. possible.;0
Such con?gurations must be saved in the user pro?le.;0
The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable.;0
"These defaults should include: 7 0 user?de?nable values; 0 values same as previous item; 0 values derived from context, e.g.";0
Where the System employs a graphical user interface, it must allow users to customise it.;1
Customisation should include, but need not be limited to the following changes: Usability 1.;0
The user interfaces should be designed to make them user?intuitive.;0
The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241.;0
ICT accessibility: ISO 9241?20 shall be the standard for guidance on ICT accessibility.;0
Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and recommendations.;0
User interfaces should meet its requirements and recommendations.;0
Content accessibility WCAG 1.0 shall be the standard used for guidance on content accessibility.;0
General guidance on achieving self?descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241?110.;0
Offering altemative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a speci?c unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.;0
If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered.;1
Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop?up windows should only be opened if this supports the user?s task.;0
Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons.;1
They could make it cognitively more dif?cult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility.;0
They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows.;0
This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page.;0
Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.;0
Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices.;0
The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, ?elds and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities.;1
In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable Via a keyboard.;0
Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology.;1
This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies.;1
This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page.;0
Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized.;0
Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface.;0
Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e.;0
Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be suf?cient so as not to impede readability.;1
Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences.;0
Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement.;1
Distinguishable within?page links: Within?page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page.;0
Within?page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines 24.;1
Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.;0
Using appropriate terminology speci?c to the user?s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.;1
Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or pop?up windows should be clearly marked.;0
Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action.;1
space ?lled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the Visual skimming of the page.;1
Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page.;0
Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly.;0
Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.;0
Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information.;1
Color should never be the only means of coding.;1
When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other.;0
Providing altematives to frame?based presentation: If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided.;0
Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in ?nding similar information at the same position on different pages.;1
Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure.;1
Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content.;0
In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently.;0
Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.;0
Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account.;1
The Intemational Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance.;0
Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241?14 to ISO 9241?17.;0
ISO 9241?14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241?15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241?16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241?17 about forms.;0
In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915?1 to ISO 14915?3 should be taken into account.;0
Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.;0
Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.;0
Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.;1
Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be 41' placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.;1
User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible.;1
Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e.;0
individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e.;0
Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the 44' user when individualization and/ or adaptation are used.;0
Making user pro?les evident: If prede?ned user pro?les or user?speci?ed pro?les 45 are used for individualizing or adapting content, the pro?le currently used should ' be made evident.;1
If pro?les are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications.;1
46 Allowing users to see and change pro?les: If user?speci?ed pro?les are used, users ' should be able to see, modify and delete that pro?le on demand.;0
Unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed per 3' .;0
4 The number of incidents of unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed ' per .;0
5 In the event of any software or hardware failure, it must be possible to restore the System (with inline synchronization) within no more than hours.;0
In this context, performing a search means returning a result list.;0
It does not include retrieving the records themselves.;0
The System must be able to retrieve and display within 5?8 seconds the case which has been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or 3. number of cases in the system.;0
This requirement is intended to allow for rapid retrieval of frequently?used cases, on the understanding that frequency of use is typically correlated with recent use.;0
The System be scaleable and must not have any features which would preclude use in small or large police stations, with varying numbers of cases handled.;0
The proposed functional architecture is modeled around centralized deployment to facilitate ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in open standards and web technologies.;0
The 3 C?s (Core?Con?guration?Customization) forms the guiding principle for the architecture.;0
The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the ?gure below.;1
The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles.;0
Each of the components contains multiple services as de?ned by Service De?nition.;0
The core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as standard components with necessary con?guration changes.;0
The customization layer can override and add to the core services based on the speci?c state requirements and can be plugged with the core services.;1
The deployment of the application will be at state level and will be con?gured and customized as per the state speci?c extensions.;0
Central trading System.;0
The central trading system (CTS) is to complete the trading of stock.;0
It analyses the instructions that enter the central trading system and diVides them into several kinds of instructions.;0
The system will make a match between them under specifical prescripts.;0
Also, the central trading system provides some interfaces to send messages to other modules.;0
The CTS is just a subsystem of the whole stock trading system (STS) system.;0
There are mainly siX subsystems involved, stock account operation, ?nancing account operation, trade client serve, network message promulgating, central trading system and trading system manage.;0
Communications exist among these subsystems which complicates the relationships between subsystems. The CTS receive instructions from trade client serve.;0
Then the CTS produces new messages which to be sent to network message promulgating after dealing with the instructions from trade client serve.;0
Also, the system manager is authorized to access the information in CTS. There are mainly two kinds of users.;0
The CTS provides the terminal users easy Operations that are con?ned to a series of mouse clicks and keyboard, which compared to other systems are really much simpli?ed.;0
However, for another user, things are different .;0
the maintainers of this CTS must be familiar with java programming and the socket.;0
When the system crashes down, they can find the cause and ?x it.;0
When new requirements should be supported, they can modify the program to make it ?t.;0
As the instruction is frequently operated in CTS such as fetch, deal with, repeal and so on, the CTS is heavily transferred.;0
The program must take this into consideration.;1
The maintainers of CTS should have good strategies to overcome crash of the system when overhead exceeds the capacity of it.;0
There are mainly five kinds of actors, which here consist of other related sub-systerns, involved with our Central Trading System.;1
Often, user-scenario is considered the same to use-case.;0
They both can help our team understand how system functions and features will be used by different classes of end-users (actors).;0
However, I prefer to understand it like this: a user scenario is a particular environment within a specified use case.;0
So, I will specify user-scenarios going along with developing use cases in the next session. Preconditions . . 1nformat10n Trigger;0
central trading system: save the buy instruction 3 central trading system: match the instructions with the Scenario same stock id 4.;0

The central trading system has relation with three modules that are trading client serve.;1
These modules have contact with CTS usin g the interface supplied by CTS. 7.1.1 Transaction User Interface;0
The Transaction User Interface has to input the instructions.;0
This instruction should have ?ve parameters: user ID, stock ID, quantity, respected price, tirnestarnp.;0
This instruction can be divided into two kinds: user query instruction and the stock query instruction.;1
The user query instruction should have three Version 1.0 parameters: user ID, query content, some restrict parameters.;1
The stock query instruction should has three parameters: stock ID, query content, some restrict pararnetera 7.1.2 Information Releasing Module;0
The information releasing module use the interface to ?nd the price of the stocks.;1
The input should has two parameters including the stock name and the restrict parameter. 7.1.3 Trading manager system;0
The trading manager system uses the interface to ?nd the user?s trading instruction.;1
The input should has two parameters including the trading instruction type(buy or sell),and the restrict parameter. 7.2 Function Criteria;0
The CTS deals with trading instruction, query instruction and some cancel instruction.;1
The functions are as follows: I) instruction matching;0
When the client serve get a trading instruction, it will send the instruction to the CTS to trade with other trading instructions.;1
The process of the trading includes the following two main principles: price ?rst principle and the time ?rst principle.;0
If the trading fails when these two principles have been applied, we should refer to another principle.;0
The trading states are diVided into two kinds: totally ?nished and the partially ?nished. 4) outdated instruction;0
If a instruction haven?t ?nished it?s trading in one day, then it will be removed form the CTS for out of date. 17 Version 1.0;1
Software Requirements Specification for KeePass Password Safe;0
This document includes software requirements for KeePass Password Safe, release number 1.10.;0
KeePass Password Safe is an OSI Certified Open Source Software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 2 or under.;0
The system gives resolution to memorizing passwords problem.;0
Its purpose is to keep all of the user?s passwords, data, email accounts, usernames and URLs stored in a very secure, encrypted database, protected by a Master Password.;0
The system is very small so it can be easily transferred from one computer to another.;0
It provides several functionalities on the already encrypted data and the new ones to be inserted.;0
The database produced, is protected by a Master Password only known by its inventor with no backup if lost. 1.2 Document Conventions 0;0
This requirement document contains general information about KeePass, main classes and use cases, functions, features and special technologies.;0
It describes in detail all that KeePass needs to work properly and with safety.;0
The rest of the document is divided into chapters for better understanding. 0;0
In chapter 2 an overall description of KeePass is provided.;0
First product perspective is presented with product features and main functions.;0
Then follow user classes and characteristics, operating environments that KeePass supports as well as design and implementation constraints.;0
After all that user documentation is presented and will provide you with more details about each feature?s technology. 0;0
In chapter 5 requirements about safety and performance are presented.;0
So it provides you a very secure, encrypted database where you can keep inside all your passwords, usernames, email accounts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to find them.;0
That is because KeePass Password Safe can lock every database with only one Master Password and/or key file.;0
There are no duplicates, anywhere in your computer, of this Master Password and/or key file so in case of lost database cannot be opened by anyone.;0
Those are analyzed in the following pages. More about KeePass you can find out at http://keepass.info/ 1.5 References More about KeePass can be found at 0 http://soarcef0rge.net/proiects/keepass/;0
In this website you can find out more about the project and discuss any questions in the forums.;0
You can go back and look at preVious releases, code and problems that have been solved.;0
There you can also find information about the developers as well as the project?s main characteristics such as programming language and algorithms 0;0
Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective KeePass consists of a database which contains data for one or more users.;0
Each user?s data are diVided into groups and subgroups so that they are organized in a form that serves right the user.;0
Every user has a unique Master Key which can be simple or composite and its combination opens uniquely the database.;0
If lost there is no recovery.;0
Groups and subgroups contain entries with usernames, passwords URLs etc that can be sent or copied to websites, application and accounts.;0
There is also the ability for a onetime key creation to be used once in a transaction without the risk of reused by others for any reason.;0
In the diagram below there are the main components of the system, subsystem interconnections and external interfaces to help you understand the main idea of KeePass.;0
The database can be opened and closed whenever user wants it.;0
Changes on the data are permitted and the changes can be saved.;1
The user also can print all data in order to keep them with him even when a computer is not available.;1
Also the user can search the database using key words through a search engine provided with the software.;0
Last but not least, the database can be imported and/or exported from/to the Internet. 0 Group/Subgroup ?;0
New groups and subgroups can be added easily and can be deleted the same way.;0
The feature of searching can be applied in just one group and not in the whole database if wanted. 0 Entry ? Add, View/Edit, Duplicate, Delete;0
A new entry can be added in any group or subgroup and it contains title, username, password, URL and notes.;0
Not all fields are required for an entry.;0
An entry can be duplicated and deleted in the click of a button. 0 Change Language;0
At KeePass website there are available language translations that can be downloaded and applied easily. 0;0
The user can select a sequence of keypresses that KeePass will be able to perform and send them to any window or browser. 0 Command Line Options;0
All these together form the Composite Master Key and are all required in order to open the database.;1
So the user cannot use a combination of them to unlock the database. 0 Configuration;0
There are available generations based on character sets and based on patterns the first for generating random passwords and the second for creating passwords which require specific patterns.;0
There is also available generating passwords that follow rules which are determined further down on this document.;1
Then there are security-reducing options which reduce the security of the passwords they are applied to.;0
When this option is turned on, secure edit controls stronger than the ones of Windows are protecting your data and no one can access them, see them or steal them. 0;0
TAN Support KeePass uses TAN-Transaction Authentication Numbers for even more security.;0
This feature can be used for generating one time passwords so that there won?t be any chance, for anyone to access e.g. your bank account even if he finds out that password.;1
That is because when the password is entered one time it becomes useless.;0
TANs can be added using the TANs wizard. 0 URL Field;0
The URL field supports various special protocols and placeholders and can be used for Standard capabilities where URL field can execute valid URLs for which a protocol handler is defined.;1
In addition to that, KeePass supports all registered protocols that Internet Explorer supports.;1
URL field also offers the ability of executed command lines instead of URLs.;0
Also, placeholders can be used that will be automatically replaced when the URL is executed. 0;0
Using Stored Passwords Passwords that are stored in the database can be copied to website accounts and applications with security and without retyping them again.;0
This can be done by several methods such us ConteXt-Sensitive Password List, Drag and Drop, Auto-Type and KeeForm.;0
All of them are explained better further down. Software Requirements Specification for KeePass Password Safe Page 6 0 Lock Workspace Last but not least at all is the locking workspace feature.;0
This feature is turned on and locks the database when minimized.;0
So to unlock it the Master Key is required again.;1
The workspace can be locked manually as well by selecting this option from File menu. 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics 0;1
The user interfaces used are: NET/Mono, Win32 (MS Windows);1
When a password is copied for any reason, (e.g. copy to an application, account, and website) it remains in the memory for only 10 seconds.;0
After 10 seconds pass there is nothing to paste and you have to recopy again.;0
That provides security in a case a password is copied and not pasted anywhere so no one can find it out by pasting later. Language Requirements in KeePass Password Safe:;0
Not in all translations translated help files and tutorials are available. Specific Technologies used in KeePass Password Safe: 0;0
In order to keep the user?s data fully protected, 2 very secure algorithms are used: Cipher Block Size Key Size Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael) 128 bits 256 bits Twofish 128 bits 256 bits;0
In both algorithms every time the user saves a database, a random 128-bit initialization vector is generated. 0;0
For the creation of the 256-bit key the Cipher uses, the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-256 is used. 0;0
A compiled HTML Help file with a tutorial and full help on all features provided 0;0
A KeePass Internet shortcut which take the user in the system?s official website where are available downloads, translations, plug-ins and extensions. Software Requirements Specification for KeePass Password Safe Page 8 3.;0
System Features System features are organized by use cases and functional hierarchy so that the main functions of the system will be understandable. 3.1 New Database;1
It is the first thing a user must do to begin using KeePass.;0
Its main function is the determination of the master password that will unlock the database from now on Stimulus/Response Sequences Data Flow 3.1.2.1 Basic Data Flow 1.;0

When this happens, a list of data types that can be printed are shown and the user can select the data to be printed.;1
User selects print from file menu 3.;0
The list of options opens with checked the fields: password groups, title, user name, password, URL, notes 4.;0
User unselects all fields 3b.;0
This is very useful when the user needs to find out very quickly which password is required in one account or what username he has put on another account.;0
It is not necessary to write in the search field all characters.;0
By writing just one character the database will present all data which contains it or are related with it. 3.5.2.;0

In order to find something in a group a word must be placed in the find field 3.10 Add Entry;1
When he does this, a window opens which is actually a form.;0
In this form the user completes the fields he wants.;0
Not all fields are required for an entry to be created.;0
In fact an entry can be added with no fields at all.;1
By selecting OK the entry is created in the group selected. Stimulus/Response Sequences Data Flow 3.10.2.1 Basic Data Flow 1.;1
User opens KeePass and selects to add an entry;0
User fills in the form, as many fields as he wants, from 1 to 9 3.;0

If he wants another language pack he can select get more language.;0
Doing this he will be transferred at KeePass website and choose the language he wants for downloading. Stimulus/Response Sequences Data Flow 3.14.2.1 Basic Data Flow 1.;0
User opens KeePass and selects to change language from the View menu;0
The user selects a language to load from the list that appears 3.;1
A message appears that informs user that the installation has been done and in order for the changes to take place KeePass must be restarted Software Requirements Specification for KeePass Password Safe Page 21 4.;1
KeePass asks to save any changes that may have been made in the database and restarts 6.;0
User selects get more languages;0
The browser opens in KeePass website were translations are located 4.;1
User selects a language he wants 5.;1
The user defines the sequences which can be sent to any other open window like browsers or login accounts.;1
By default the sent keystroke sequence is {USERNAME} {TAB } {PASSWORD} {ENTER}.;1
There is the ability for the user to define his own auto-type sequence in the notes field of each entry.;0
The sequence must be prefixed with ?Auto-Type? and length of one line.;0
If a sequence is more than a line it cannot be used and in case of two sequences in one note?s field only the first one is used.;0
There are 3 methods to invoke auto-type.;0
Software Requirements Specification for KeePass Password Safe Page 22 0;0
The first method is to use the context menu command and perform auto-type while the entry is selected. 0;1
The second method is to select an entry and press Ctrl+V 0;1
The third method is to use the system?wide auto-type hot key so that KeePass can search all entries in the database for matching sequences. 3.;1
15 .2 Functional Requirements REQ?l9: The prefix ?Auto-Typez? is required in front of each sequence REQ?20: Sequence?s length must not be more than a line (59 characters);1
The database file location is passed as argument in the command line.;0
This feature is a composition of master password and key files and all its composites are required so that the database can be unlocked. 3.17.1 Description;0
The database can be unlocked with a master password, a key file or both of them.;0
But the same composition of them must be used always.;1
A master key is a password the user creates.;1
Once a master key is created for a database, it is always required.;0
In case the user forgets it, the database can never be opened again by any way. A key file is a file that locks the database.;0
The database opens when this file is present.;0
If the file is lost and there are no copies of it, all data are gone forever and database never unlocks again. Software Requirements Specification for KeePass Password Safe Page 23 3.17.2 Functional Requirements REQ?24:;0
Import/Export If a master password is required to unlock the database, the database doesn?t open unless the password is entered;1
If a key file is required to unlock the database, the database doesn?t open unless;0
In case of lost master password or key file, the database never unlocks again.;0
Despite that, almost all support exporting to CSV or XML files.;0
This feature allows switching back from an application to KeePass. 3.19.1 Description;0
The global hot key takes the user back from one window to KeePass.;0
In case of multiple databases running of KeePass the global hot key restores the window which was opened first of all.;1
This password may contain letters (big and small) and numbers.;1
The user can keep it or he can put his own in the field.;0
The generation can be based on character sets, patterns or can be created according by rules.;0
This feature can be disabled if user wants it by selecting 0 as password length in the password generator dialog.;0
More about characters sets and patterns can be found at KeePass Help Files including directions and examples.;0
They can be added to user?s database by using TAN wizard and can contain all letters and numbers.;0
When TAN are created, they appear as typical entries which in the field title contain ?;0
? so that KeePass will know it?s a TAN. In TAN entries, user cannot change the title, user name or URL but notes can be added.;0
When a TAN is used, its expiration time is set to that current time and the entry expires automatically. Functional Requirements REQ?32: Title, username or URL cannot be changed in a TAN entry.;0
When a TAN is used, it expires automatically and can never be used again. Software Requirements Specification for KeePass Password Safe Page 25 4.;1
External Interface Requirements 4.1 User Interfaces User interface includes various forms and windows.;0
The main database window consists of the main menu bar with file, edit, View, tools and help.;0
Under main menu there is a toolbar with shortcuts to most used functions of KeePass.;0
Those are: new, open, save, add entry, edit/View entry, delete entry, copy username to clipboard, copy password to clipboard, find in database and lock workspace.;1
On the main database window are appeared entries from a selected group.;0
Groups and subgroups can be found at a side bar.;0
When a function is performed like adding, editing or deleting, the active window is the one performing the action.;0
Other Nonfunctional Requirements 5.1 Performance Requirements;0
When a password is copied, it remains on memory for only 10 seconds.;0
If in the meanwhile it is not pasted anywhere, it must be copied again.;0
That happens so that if user copies a password and not paste it anywhere, the password cannot be found by anyone later. 5 .2 Safety Requirements;1
When a USB which contains the database is removed from a computer while changes haven?t been completely saved, the database is damaged and cannot be opened.;0
In this case the repair functionality can help by repairing KeePass database file from tools menu.;0
In case the user forgets or loses the Master Password, the repair functionality won?t help.;0
KeePass is a small and light proj ect;0
so it does not need to be installed.;0
All it takes is unpacking from the Zip package.;0
It can be transferred also in a USB stick with no additional configuration needed. 0;0
KeePass is a project that once uninstalled from a computer, leaves no trace behind.;0
So there is no way passwords and other data in the database to be found later. 0;0
KeePass is developed under GNU General Public License version 2 or later (copy from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gplhtml) and can be distributed under those terms. 0;0
KeePass can be found and downloaded from www.sourceforge.com and the proj ect?s official website at http://keepass.info/ for free.;0

Construction Junction Inventory Management Software Requirements Specification Version 2.0;0
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements of the Inventory Management System as proposed by the Construction Junction (CJ) staff. 1.2. Scope;0
Requirements defined in this document are prioritized by business and technical sponsors (Please refer to Appendix A).;0
Overview The Inventory Management System is an application designed to allow the Construction Junction staff to create, maintain and view the contents and value of its inventory of items in a categorized way.;0
It also facilitates the process of receiving items into the Construction Junction inventory via the drop-off, pick-up and deconstruction donation processes so that items can be traced from donation through sale.;0
This section contains a description of each actor that interfaces with the system:;0
Administrator: A member of the Construction Junction staff who can perform any of the Inventory Management functions.;0
Decon Associate: A member of the Construction Junction staff who executes a deconstruction and/or strip out job and brings the items for processing at the receiving dock.;0
A customer who purchases items from the Construction Junction inventory.;0
Primary Contact: An individual who is the primary contact for a donation.;0
The individual may be the actual donor or be acting on behalf of one.;0
Vendor: An individual or organization who sells items to be added to Construction Junction?s inventory Consigner: An individual who donates items to Construction Junction under consignment. 3.;0
Detailed Functional Requirements This section contains detailed reports for each product-functional use cases.;0
Each report contains the following data or sections (if a section has no content for a use case, it has been removed): Name of the use case High-level description Actor(s): All actors who interact with the system during the course of the use case.;0
Pre-conditions: Pre-conditions are conditions that must be true prior to beginning the use case and are assumed to be true throughout the use case. Triggers:;1
Use Case Dependencies: Other use cases which this use case depends on. Basic Flows: The flows for the standard, expected execution of the use case.;1
The system should provide a categorized view of the entire inventory to the Construction Junction staff.;1
Starting at the department level, users can navigate into the inventory item categories and sub- categories, all the way down to an individual inventory item. 3.1.1. Actor(s):;1
Administrator Director Manager Customer Service Representative;0

A particular item by item number 4.2.;0
All items with Donor, Department, Category or Description matching the provided keyword 4.3.;1
All items with certain attributes, features and/or details;1
3.1.6. Business Rules: 1. Inventory departments and categories are displayed in matrix format;1
2. The matrix dimensions are fixed, and are the same when displaying departments or categories.;1
3. Unused matrix cells are displayed empty. 4.;1
The actual matrix dimensions are to be determined during system implementation. 4.1.;1
Each matrix cell displays a department or category name.;1
For departments with subcategories, the department name is a hyperlink to the view of the department subcategories 5.2.;0
For categories with subcategories, the category name is a hyperlink to the view of the subcategories 5.4.;0
The category name is not a hyperlink 6.;0
By default, the items list contains the list of all Unique and Stock items in the selected department or category, or across all departments and categories when viewing the all inventory items screen 7.;0
When a search keyword is specified, the system filters the default items list for that screen and returns only the items for which the keyword matches one or more of the following columns: 7.1.;0

Off acquisitions in CRM in order to access that functionality.;1
A donor in possession of a valid acquisition number can proceed to the receiving dock where the items to be donated will be received and processed, and a donation receipt will be generated.;0
Alternatively, a donor may go directly to the receiving dock, in which case a new acquisition is created by the Receiving Associate before items can be received and processed.;1
The screens used for the acquisition process should simplify and expedite the data entry process, allowing the Receiving Associate to enter only the information needed to generate the donation receipt.;1
Additional attributes needed to complete the item information and effectively add the item to the inventory can be added at a second step, after the receipt has been printed and the donor has been served.;1
The Receiving Associate can print temporary acquisition labels for items that require further processing.;1
Pick Up and Decon crews may also initiate the receiving process, entering as much detailed information about the donated items as desired, and generating a donation receipt.;0
They cannot, however, add items to the inventory or complete the acquisition process.;1
A Receiving Associate is required to review all the acquisition information before those actions can take place.;0

The MMF launched a project to establish an electronic money market environment in South Africa.;0
UNEXcor and STRATE tendered for the dematerialisation and settlement of money market instruments and in September 2002, the MMF appointed UNEXcor as the service provider.;0
Pursuant to the appointment of UNEXcor as the service provider of the dematerialisation and settlement of money market instruments an agreement to merge STRATE and UNEXcor has been reached effective from 01 August 2003.;0
The new entity, hereinafter referred to as STRATE, will provide the services as originally tendered by UNEXcor.;0
The JSE is a paid-up member of the Association of National Numbering Agents (ANNA), i.e.;0
an authorised National Numbering Agent (NNA) - an entity authorised to issue ISINs in accordance with ISO and ANNA rules and guidelines.;0
In terms of the requirements of ANNA, only one NNA may be authorised per country.;0
The JSE issues and disseminates ISINs for equities when a new equity is loaded in the mainframe programme - EQUITY MASTER DATA (EMD).;0
All equity master data is managed and maintained by the JSE's Listings Division.;0
The JSE's Market Information Division also maintains and issues ISINs for bonds, as a service to BESA, in the mainframe programme GILT MASTER DATA (MDGL), which is a manual process.;0
The scope of this project is to provide an electronic method to enable the MMF participants via STRATE to create, amend and delete ISIN codes for money market instruments.;0
This document sets out the business requirements for the issuing of money market instruments ISIN codes by the JSE.;0
The costs will be forwarded to STRATE for their review and approval and only thereafter, subject to NMPG approval of the SWIFT messages to be used and message content, will design and development start taking place.;0
(Note: -Due to unforeseen complications, the design and development has been completed prior to the costs being approved by STRATE.;0
5. Business Requirements 5.1 Current Business Environment Money market instruments are normally traded and settled on the same business day (T+0).;0
Settlement is on a gross physical basis between seller and buyer.;0
The majority of activity in the money market is undertaken in the primary market (i.e.;1
between issuer and buyer) and the typical participants in this market are registered banks.;0
The Objectives of the Electronic Money Market are as follows: - ? Reduce the identified risks associated with Money Market practices.;0
? Improve liquidity in the Money Market.;0
? Improve the tradability of the instruments in the secondary market.;1
? Reduce the inherent costs in Money Market processes.;1
? Improve the marketability of instruments, creating a competitive benefit for an institution trading in Money Market instruments.;1
? Align South African market practices and procedures with world best practices.;1
? Improve the integrity of the Money Market creating an environment that is safe, secure, structured, formalised and robust.;1
The MMF estimates an issuance requirement of approximately 200 to 500 ISINs per day.;1
To distinguish money market instruments ISINs from equities (ZAE) and bonds (ZAG) the MMF has requested the use of an ISIN prefix of ZAM.;0
The automated ISIN Issuance for Money Market Instruments system will be implemented by the JSE in the 2nd quarter 2004.;0
The following assumptions have been made: ? The Custodian and Banker components are incorporated into one entity - CSDP.;0
? The Trading component refers to either a system (Trading or Reporting Engine) or the act of reaching a contractual agreement (i.e.;0
The JSE?s ASD department will be required to develop a programme for the automatic issuance of ISINs for money market instruments.;0
"This will include a programme to ""unstring"" the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages and ?string? the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages, as detailed in Appendix B to K, for the request and notification of ISINs by/to STRATE.";0
To differentiate between the JSEs current SWIFT BIC codes and ensure correct routing and message identification the JSE will apply for a new branch code ?ISN? as an extension of their current BIC address.;1

Office of Attorney Appointments determines the appropriate appointment rotation list based upon the highest level and degree of offense Defendant is accused of committing.;1
Office of Attorney Appointments selects next Defense Attorney in the appointment rotation list.;1
Office of Attorney Appointments notifies Defendant, Defense Attorney and Detention Facility Officer of appointment by facsimile and/or electronic mail.;1
Alternative Path 1 Defendant has been released from custody This alternative path replaces the basic path beginning at step 3.;0
The approach provides a common ?Ianguage? for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts.;0
This speci?cation does not include the XML schema to be used.;0
"No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ?black boxes?.";0
The following aspects of procurement are out of scope: 0 Seller discovery.;0
0 on-Iine negotiation and e-auctions.;1
"0 e-tendering; 0 negotiation of terms and conditions of trade.";1
0 communication with third parties and intermediaries e.g.;1
carriers, banks and fiscal authorities.;0
0 message transport and security.;1
0 data protection and retention rules.;1
0 the application of public sector purchasing policy.;1
eProcurement is a many-to-many electronic data interchange (EDI) problem on a large scale and requires both the sender and the receiver to interpret each and every data element in precisely the same way.;1
In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.;0
This specification is not prescriptive regarding Document variants and, in particular, the business rules that may be required to provide automated support for the provision of copies, revisions and cancellations.;0
These requirements support several Government initiatives, including.;0
0 the generation of value for money efficiency savings.;1
0 the wish from ministerial level for the UK to be the best place to do e-business.;1
0 that 100% of interactions between Government and business be available electronically by 2005.;1
The greatest bene?ts accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re-keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.;1
One example is the ?three-way match? between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.;0
Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer?s back office.;0
Cross?Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).;0
This specification provides a clear ?stake in the ground? for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.;0
Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple specifications.;0
This work has been undertaken within the e-Commerce team in the Of?ce of Government Commerce (OGC), reporting to a joint eProcurement Interoperability Working Group of the OGC and the Office of the e-Envoy (OeE).;1
Aworking group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.;0
These requirements have been re?ned through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.;0
"The method used is based on the OeE?s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF); see www.qovtalk.qov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.asp.";0
The scope for this speci?cation is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.;0
This broad domain is broken down into four main business processes.;0
Sourcing includes activity prior to placing a formal order, including the exchange of Catalogue information, Requests For Quotation (RFQ) and Quotations.;0
Ordering includes Purchase Orders and responses.;1
Fulfilment includes delivery/despatch noti?cation, receipt (including variances) and Seller's proposed recti?cation of any problems.;0
Accounting includes Invoices (including Self Billed Invoices) Credit Notes, Debit Notes, Statements and Remittance Advice.;1
Each business process involves the exchange of information between the Buyer and the Seller, using a number of Documents.;0
Documents Produced in Each Business Process.;1
Sourcing Request for Quotation Catalogue.;1
Ordering Purchase Order Purchase Order Response.;1
Fulfilment Receipt Advice Ful?lment Notification.;1
Accounting Self Billed Invoice Invoice.;1
Debit Note Credit Note.;1
Remittance Advice Statement.;1
The Documents included are: Catalogue RFQ (Request for Quotation) Quotation is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to provide Item price and other information for use in locally held Catalogues.;0
Is a request from the Buyer to the Seller to quote terms and conditions under which the Seller is willing to supply speci?c goods or services.;0
Variants may support revision or cancellation of the Purchase Order either in content (Items ordered or quantity of Items) and/or in terms of fulfilment (changed delivery details, required by date etc).;1
|t acknowledges that the Purchase Order has been received and that it will be ful?lled in total, in part or not at all.;0
It may also give additional information about specific delivery.;0
The Documents included are: Fulfilment Notification is sent by the Seller to tell the Buyer that goods have been despatched or delivered or that a service has been performed.;1
The Seller may use this Document to notify the Buyer of shipping details via a third party carrier and to notify partial or complete delivery of a Purchase Order.;1
Receipt Advice is sent by the Buyer to the Seller to acknowledge receipt in full or in part and to describe discovered variances e.g.;0
un-noti?ed under?delivery, over?delivery, wrong Items delivered or damaged goods.;0
Rectification Advice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to tell the Buyer of action to be taken regarding the goods or services at variance from the actual requirement e.g.;0
the Seller may ask the Buyer to return the goods, await collection of the goods (by the Seller or his carrier) or destroy the goods.;0
2.1.4 Accounting The Documents included are: Invoice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to request payment for goods delivered or services performed.;1
Invoice is a Value Added Tax (VAT) Document.;0
Self Billed Invoice is an Invoice sent from the Buyer to the Seller where the two have a self billing arrangement.;0
For more information regarding HMCE requirements for self billing, see WWW.hmce.qov.uk/forms/notices/700-62.htm Self Billed Invoice is a VAT Document.;0
Credit Note is sent from the Seller to the Buyer, confirming that the Seller owes money to the Buyer.;0
It may be used to rectify errors and/or variances in the invoicing process.;0
Credit Note is a VAT Document.;0
Debit Note is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, stating that Buyer has deducted amounts from a Seller?s Invoice.;1
A Debit Note precludes the need for a Seller to raise a Credit Note.;1
Debit Note is a VAT Document.;0
Remittance Advice is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, notifying payment and stating what Invoices, Credit and Debit Notes have been accounted for.;1
Statement is sent from the Seller to the Buyer summarising the status of the Buyer?s account and the Invoices, Remittances, Debit and Credit Notes submitted within a speci?c time period.;1
2.2 Parties A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives goods, services or information.;0
A role is a job done by a particular Party.;1
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.;1
Every Document has a sender and receiver, one of which is a Buyer role, the other a Seller role.;0
The Party types, ro|es names and Documents sent and received are shown in Table 2.;0
Seller ro|es include: Sales Point Despatch Point Customer Service Accounts Receivable is responsible for the arrangement and maintenance of trading agreements with suppliers, including Catalogue data.;1
"The Purchasing Manager is not involved in other transactions; if the Purchasing Manager requests or makes a purchase, that individual adopts the role of Originator or Order Point respectively.";1
If Originator subsequently places a Purchase Order, the Originator adopts the role of Order Point.;0
Purchase Card (credit or debit card) information may be associated with the Order Point.;0
It may include Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information i.e.;0
Note: Messages to and from banks are out of scope.;0
2.2.3 Third Party Roles Third Party ro|es include: Carrier is assigned by the Seller or the Buyer to deliver or return goods.;1
Note: Messages to and from carriers are out of scope.;0
2.3 Codes and Identifiers Semantic interoperability depends on the ability of computers to match identi?ers and codes.;0
Identifiers and codes are needed to enable: 0 the Seller to identify the Buyer.;0
commodity classification, and identi?ed at individual or Catalogue |tem level as appropriate.;0
The identi?ers, coding and classification schemes used in this specification fall into five groups: International used and maintained internationally, including: 0 country codes (ISO 3166).;0

0 locally specified identifiers for instances of: o Quotation.;1
0 Purchase Order.;1
0 Fulfilment Notification.;1
Universally Unique Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is an instance identifier Identi?ers generated on the fly as speci?ed in ISO 11587.;0
UUID is a 128 bit string usua||y formatted as 32 characters alphanumeric.;0
In this specification UUID is used for matching instances of Document and Line between Documents and for referring to multiple ro|e instances of the same Party within a single Document.;0
UUIDs provide an effective means to ensure exact matching of identifiers at machine level, but are not well suited to visual matching, which is why existing ID data are also required.;1
Common Elements Each Document is made up of a common set of elements, which are described below.;0
The descriptions are illustrated with UML class diagrams.;0
A specialisation inherits all of the properties of its parent class.;0
Some knowledge of UML is needed to understand the model fully, but the text is intended to be understandable to those who are not familiar with the UML notation.;1
contains information about each Party including organisation and person details, postal and electronic addresses.;0
A sender and a receiver are included in every Document.;1
3.2 Party A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives information, goods or services.;0
A role is a job done by a particular Party.;0
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.;0
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.;0
The full details of any Party only need to be provided once and other occurences of the same Party may be cross-referenced using Party UUID.;1
is the unstructured name of an individual within an organisation.;0
Unstructured name is typically entered manua||y at the time of the transaction.;0
When an unstructured address is used, it must have 1 to 5 Lines.;0
The UK Post Code is a combination of between five and seven letters and numbers which define four different levels of geographic unit.;1
Although Post Code cannot be made mandatory in all circumstances, it should be present if known.;0
This needs to be coded to enable collection of management data on source of imports and exports.;0
For companies registered in England and Wales, this is the company Registration Number issued by Companies House, Cardiff.;0
VAT Identifier includes Country Code (as above) and VAT number.;1
It is a specific Internet identifier that contains a locally interpreted string followed by the ?at? sign (@) followed by an Internet domain.;0
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.;0
The full details of any Party only need to be provided once and other occurences of the same Party may be cross-referenced using Party UUID.;0
(PAON) is the premise number and/or premise name, or where neithe rof these exist it is the name of the organisation in occupation or a description of the addressable object e.g.;1
Where an industrial estate contains streets it is defined as a locality in its own right.;0
UK |nterna| Code is used if the Country Code is GB.;0
"3.2.3 Extended Electronic Address eAddress XE ""URL""eAddress Channel eAddress Use is the number or string of the electronic address or telephone number.";1

Software Requirements Specification for Grid 3D Application This document uses the Volere template for writing and designing requirements specifications.;0
The template itself is copyright.;0
We hereby acknowledge this copyright.;0
Details can be found at the Atlantic Systems Guild web site at www.atlsysguild.com.;0
PRODUCT CONSTRAINTS 1.1 Purpose of the the Product 1.1.1 Background to the Project Effort The need for a method of visualisation of biological data has been identified.;0
Currently, there are many groups offering many different tools for visualising data.;0
These visualisation tools provide a range from tabular to three-dimensional graphical views.;0
However, a need has been identified for a tool that can display data in a three dimensional environment, which allows the user to investigate the data and easily see various attributes of the data at a glance.;0
A need for the above-mentioned tool has been identified and, there being no applicable tool available, a project to create such a tool was conceptualised.;0
The primary stakeholder (see 1.2.1) has made the case that the tool to be created is of relevance use and there is a real need for it.;0
This need is established through continual use of other similar tools and a continued identification of their shortfalls.;0
1.1.2 Goals of the Product We want to give the user the ability to visualise and investigate their data in a three dimensional environment.;0
The user should have the ability to see (at a glance) the differences of various selected attributes of their data.;1
The overall goal of this product is to provide the users with something that has previously been unavailable.;1
1.2 Client, Customer and other Stakeholders 1.2.1 The Client The client for this product is Dr Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes, a supervisor at the NIMR.;0
Eventually, the client would like to present and make available the product for the benefit of research merit.;1
The client has said that he is solely responsible for approving changes in the scope of the project.;1
1.2.2 The Customer The customer for this product is anyone from the parasitology department at the NIMR, represented here by Dr Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes.;0
Potential customers may include anyone who works in the field of research and would find this product useful.;0
"1.3 The Users of the Product People who may use this product; ? Anyone investigating proteins.";0
1.4.2 Implementation Environment This section will describe the technological and physical environment that the product will be installed.;1
? The product should run on a minimum of a mid-range personal computer.;1
? The product shall run with the minimum input tools of mouse and keyboard.;1
? The user must have a capability for creating tab-delimited text files.;1
1.4.3 Partner Applications This section will describe some of the applications that are not part of the product, but with which the product will, or may, collaborate.;0
? Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, NT and XP Operating Systems ? Linux and Solaris Operating Systems ? Matlab ? used for some of the pre-product data generations.;1
Matlab can also be used for manipulating the format of the product's required data.;1
? Tomcat/Apache/Ant ? possibly to be used for product deployment 1.4.4 How Long to Develop?;1
The Grid 3D application was originally developed to be included for a scientific paper to be published at some point in March 2005.;0
It was, therefore, essential that the application be ready by then.;0
The motivation for developing the application within this short time frame was to, firstly, included it in the paper, but also to produce an original product in a constantly advancing genre.;0
1.5 Naming Conventions and Definitions This section shall provide a dictionary containing the meaning of all the name used within this requirements specification document.;0
? Biological data ? data of a biological scientific nature generated by some product or process (external to the Grid 3D application).;0
The demonstrator uses the three dimensional view generated by the application to demonstrate one or more properties of the data to any other person.;0
? Grid 3D ? the application for which this document contains the requirements.;0
For a detailed representation of the Grid 3D application, please refer to the Design document.;0
? Identifier ? refers to a user of the Grid 3D application.;0
The identifier use the application to identify different ?points of interest?.;0
For example, a point that is not close to any other point may be of interest.;0
An identifier may become an investigator.;1
? Investigator ? refers to a user of the Grid 3D application.;0
The investigator uses the application in order to find detailed information about specific points.;1
An investigator may originate as an identifier.;0
1.6 Assumptions This section contains a list of assumptions that are to be made by the developers.;0
? The users have the computing skill for basic operation of one of the operating systems documented in 1.4.3.;0
See 3.3 for minimum requirements for the work station.;0
For a description of any of the below-mentioned names, please refer to 1.5.;0
The context diagram above represents the Grid 3D application during the initialisation stages.;0
It is important to differentiate this with the work context for the application in a state of running.;0
The following diagram aims to describe the work context for the application when it is being run by the users (identified above).;0
In the following diagram, the users are grouped as one entity.;0
This is for convenience only and should be thought of as separate entities.;0
However, the work context applies to each of them in the same manner and, therefore, have been grouped to further the simplicity and understandability of the diagram.;0
The purpose of this section is to identify all the business events to which the product responds.;0
This is to identify the logical parts of work that can be used as the basis for discovering the detailed requirements.;0
This section aims to generate some use cases for the Grid 3D application.;0
These shall be generated from the events list contained in 2.1.2.;1
It is hoped that use cases can be given that cover all the events listed in 2.1.2.;1
With this in mind, the use cases will cover more than one event as more than one event can be captured with a single use-case.;0
This section describes the functional requirements for the Grid 3D application.;0
Each functional requirement should have a fit criterion in order to make it possible to test whether the requirement is implemented as specified in the delivered product.;0
? The product shall plot the data points in a scientifically correct manner.;1
? The grid axis should be labelled correctly according to the input from the data file.;1
? Data points should be coloured in accordance to the cluster number (contained in the data file) ? The product should be able to handle up to 2000 data points.;1
? A single click of the mouse over a data point should bring up the name of the data point.;1
? A double-click of the mouse over the data point should cause the application to display all the data point's details.;0
? The product should allow multiple points to clicked so that multiple names can be displayed.;0
? The product should allow the grid to be oriented by the user.;0
Rotation, zoom and move functions should be employed.;0
2.2.2 Data Requirements The use of the Grid 3D application involves the user supplying a data file.;0
This data file contains all the information of the points that are to be plotted.;1
This is the attribute that is to be used as the comparison.;1
? A description for the data point.;0
In order for the grid to reflect the nature of the user's data, the system should allow for the user to specify their own axis.;0
With this in mind, the first row of the data file should contain the column headings.;0
The following table proposes the format for the data file.;0
? The axis should be clearly labelled and easily recognised after the grid has been oriented into a different position.;1
? The application should be coloured so that the screen shots can be printed out clearly (i.e., black on white background).;1
? The application should be intuitive and not require any specialist training.;1
3.2 Performance Requirements This section aims to specify some of the timing and performance constraints to which the product will aim to adhere.;1
? The program should start within 30 seconds ? This depends on the number of data points that are to be plotted.;1
? The interaction with the data points should have a delay of no longer than 2 seconds.;1
? The response to a change in the orientation should be fast enough to avoid interrupting the user's flow of thought.;1
Otherwise known as the Gnome Partition Editor, it is a frontend to the GNU Parted partition editor, and specifically uses its library, libparted, to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables, and perform all the functions it has been designed for.;0
Several optional file system tools provide support for file systems not included in libparted.;0
This document deals with the functions of the 0.6.0?1 version, made available for public testing in 2010?06?19.;0
The software being described in this document has already been developed.;0
The functions and characteristics that will be analysed have already been implemented.;0
This document has to stay updated with any new features that will be added in future versions of the application.;0
Section 4 discusses the external interface requirements, and finally, in section 5, you can find the nonfunctional requirements of the project.;0
Each section is divided in subsections where different matters are discussed.;0
1.4 Project Scope GParted is one of many programs used for creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking and copying partitions, and the file systems on them.;0
This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing disk space, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).;0
With this you can boot your computer and use the application.;0
With the .zip file, you can create a bootable USB flash drive, and use that instead of the cd.;0
It is one of the best among the many of its kind, supporting more file systems and providing more functions than the rest (Clonezilla, Parted Magic, Parted (backend to GParted), Partition Image, Partition Magic for Windows etc.).;1
It is written in C++ and is based on the Debian GNU/Linux operating system.;1
It is a frontend to the GNU Parted application which was written by the GNU team and supports creating, destroying, resizing, checking, and copying partitions, and the file systems on them, but only through command line.;1
GParted provides the graphical user interface for ease of access.;1
Other programs use the Parted libraries as well, like KDE Partition Manager and Pyparted.;0
Because this is a Linux?based application it relies on some other software in order for it to work.;0
GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables.;0
This includes but is not limited to:;0
This is important, documentation and help files are vital to any project?s completeness. 2.4 Operating Environment GParted is developed on x86 based computers using GNU/Linux.;0
It can be used on other operating systems, such as Windows or Mac OS X, by booting from media containing GParted Live.;1
In other words you will need a Linux operating system for the install version of GParted.;0
The Live version, on which this document is based, needs a basic x86 ?computer, regardless of the operating system, with a CD drive and/or USB port.;0
In general, it does not consume many resources and almost every computer will be able to handle it properly. 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints;0
The program does not support every kind of operation performed in every kind of file system, but it is constantly being updated and more and more actions and file systems will be supported in the future.;1
The table of permitted actions in supported file systems is in section 2.2. GParted does not support logical volume management (LVM?) at present, although this feature has been requested by many users and may be implemented in a future release.;0
It also must be noted that GParted is not to blame, on most occasions, if a specific operation cannot be performed on a specific file system.;1
It uses a wide variety of third party libraries and tools which perform these operations.;1
GParted is simply a frontend, which brings together all these underlying functions and processes, and presents them in a graphical and accessible way. GParted requires a working Linux environment for it to work.;0
The Live version requires a working CD/DVD drive for it to boot the computer.;0
As every other Linux application, there is a list of dependencies, or a list of packages required for the program to work.;0
In this occasion, they are file system tools.;0
After booting your computer with GParted Live, this is the first screen you see. GParted provides some other modes, other than the first default.;0
These include loading to RAM only, safe graphic settings, and failsafe mode. You can also boot your computer?s operating system (if any) and run RAM tests using Memtest86+.;1
Selecting the first option, advances the application forwards and presents us with the next screen. 3.2 Select Keymap;0
"The keymap is the layout of symbols on your keyboard. Different keymaps are supported; this screen gives info about them.";0
Selecting the keymap you want, brings you to the language selection menu.;0
A list of a wide variety of supported languages is displayed.;0
You then enter the number that corresponds to the desired language.;0
After that, you are presented with a video mode preference menu.;0
The default value you type is 0, which loads the GParted Live application.;0
On the desktop you can find all the program?s functions.;0
Under that, is a bar which contains the most common functions of the program, which you can perform on the drive (hard disk, USB flash etc.) selected from the drop down menu on the far right.;0
This can be useful if, for example, you plug in a USB flash drive after GParted has booted.;0
Every time you perform an operation, it goes in pending mode.;0
Then, you can undo if you regret your choice, or go ahead and click apply for the changes to happen.;0
Clear all removes every pending operation from the list.;0
You can also undo and apply from the respective buttons on the main functions bar.;0
3.8 View Device Information You can view the selected device?s information by clicking View?>Device Information.;0
This brings up information about the selected drive on the left side of the GParted main window.;1
Details like the device?s model, size, heads, sectors, cylinders etc. are shown. ;1
A warning is displayed saying that all of your data will be erased.;1
3.9 Create Partition Table Clicking on Device?>Create Partition Table lets you create the drive?s partition table?.;0
So proceed with caution.;0
A wide variety of partition tables are supported and the default one is ms? dos. ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_table 3.10;1
Create a New Partition To create a new partition, first select the desired hard disk or other device, from the drop down menu on the right.;1
Then you can either click on New from the main functions bar, or go to Partition?>New.;0
A pop up dialog window appears on screen.;0
Here you have various options.;0
First of all, there is a slider which shrinks and moves to either side.;1
This represents the size and position of the partition you will create.;1
You can type in values by hand, or just use the slider.;1
Then, you define the type of the partition (Primary, Logical, Extended) and select the desired file system to format the partition.;1
The list is displayed in the last screenshot.;1
You can also leave the partition unformatted if you wish to and format it later.;0
If you wish to label the partition, GParted lets you do so in this dialog.;0
Press Add and then Apply to create the partition.;0
In this screenshot we have selected this part of the disk as the partition we will create.;0
It is shrunk and sits on the start of the disk.;0
In the same way, it can be larger or smaller, and sit in the end, or anywhere else on the disk. 3.11;0
Delete a Partition Select the partition you want to delete.;1
Then click on Resize/Move from the main functions bar or go to Partition?>Resize/Move.;0
A dialog window appears, with the same slider as in the create partition window.;0
You use it in the same way or type in the numbers in Megabytes directly.;0
"In this screenshot, it appears that the partition spans the whole drive; we want to shrink it and free up the disk space after it, which will then become unallocated space.";0
Press Resize/Move and then Apply. 3.13 Copy Partition Select the partition you would like to copy.;0
This is partition cloning, useful if, for example, you migrate to a larger hard drive and wish to keep your data and operating system (without reformatting). Click on Copy from the main functions bar or go to Partition?>Copy.;1
A dialog window opens.;0
As with Resize/Move, there is a slider.;0
You can leave it at the default setting, which the exact same size of the partition being copied, or you can only slide it up for the pasted partition to take up more (free) space than the copied one.;1
You can also move around the pasted partition, it doesn?t have to be at the start of the unallocated space.;1
Here you see the slider which defaults at the size of the partition to copy, but you can change that if you want.;1
IMPORTANT: You can paste over an existing partition (whether it?s formatted or unformatted).;1
A warning is shown that you will lose all of that partition?s data.;0
So paste with caution.;0
After you have created a partition (regardless of formatting it or not) you can format it to the file system you like.;0
First, select the partition you want to format.;1
Then, click on Partition?>Format to.;1
A list of the supported file systems appears.;0
Click on the desired one and then click on Apply. 3.16 Unmount Partition;0
If you have mounted a partition to a specific mount point, you can unmount it by clicking on Partition?>Unmount.;0
Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Manage Flags, brings up a dialog window with flags and checkboxes. These are functions supported by the partition, like if the partition is bootable, if it is hidden etc.;1
Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Check, sends in pending mode the check and repair partition errors operation.;1
Click on Apply to have the partition?s file system analyzed, checked for errors and repaired if errors are found. 3.19 Label Partition;0
Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Label, opens a dialog window asking to name your partition.;1
You could also do that when creating the partition, but if you missed it or didn?t want to do it then, you can label your partition from this option.;0
You cannot label every partition, because some file systems don?t support labeling. 3.20;0
Take a Screenshot of the Desktop or an Active Window Clicking on Screenshot on the desktop, opens a dialog window which informs you that after clicking Yes, a cross?pointer appears and you select the window you want to print?screen.;1
When the cross?hair appears, you can click on any active window to take its screenshot, or click somewhere in the desktop?s wallpaper for a general desktop screenshot.;0
A preview of the screenshot is displayed, and a pop?up message informs you that your screenshot has been saved as gparted.jpeg under /root.;0
For saving screenshots to a device, please refer to 3.21. 3.21 Terminal & Mount Partitions and Save Screenshots to a Device;0
Apart from the main GParted window, you can also launch a command line utility by clicking on Terminal.;0
This is useful for more advanced operations, or if some operations cannot be performed in the main GParted window.;0
The supported shell is bash.;0
For example, you can mount a partition to a mount point in the system.;0
This can be done only through Terminal.;0
It is also used for copying your saved screenshots from the system?s virtual drive to a hard disk or USB flash drive.;0
The first option opens Terminal and presents you with a list of packages and libraries installed in GParted.;0
The second option opens resize?windows.txt in Terminal, which shows you some things you should be careful of when resizing Windows XP and Windows Vista partitions.;0
You quit by pressing q. 3.23 Screen Resolution Changer Clicking on Screen resolution brings up a window with monitor resolution options.;0
Here you can select the resolution that best fits your monitor.;0
This is the first screen of the program that the user sees, and the part where most of the operations take place.;0
On the top, there is the menu bar with each option (GParted, Edit, View, Device, Partition) corresponding to a set of actions you can perform on a disk.;0
Under that, is a bar which contains the most common functions of the program.;0
Then the selected drive?s partitions are presented in both graphical and detailed mode. ? Cancel and Apply;0
Every time you try to edit in any way, any partition, a confirmation dialog appears which warns about the potential of data loss.;0
You can either click Cancel or Apply. ? Pasting into an existing partition You can copy a partition, and then paste it on another existing one, whether it is formatted or not.;0
This of course leads to loss of data.;0
If that?s fine, click OK on the warning window that is being displayed. ? Quitting GParted You can exit GParted at any time you wish, by clicking on Exit on the upper left corner of the desktop. You can select Reboot, Shutdown, or Logout.;1
For the GParted Live to run, you will need a PC (regardless of its operating system, it can be Windows or Linux) or Mac, with or without an operating system.;0
Since it is not a resource hungry program, it will run on most systems without a problem.;0
A CD/DVD drive is necessary for the application to boot, or at least one USB port if you plan to use the USB version of GParted Live.;1
However, GParted depends on some libraries and tools for its function.;0
These packages are already pre?included in the .iso image file you downloaded from GParted?s website.;0
Please refer to 2.7 for more details on that matter.;0
Before booting with GParted Live, you have to download the image file and then burn it to a cd.;0
Although network or Internet communication is not obvious, it is available.;0
You can configure your network adapter to work with GParted by typing in the Terminal: dhclient eth0.;1
You can also use the ifconfig and route commands.;1
Please remember to edit /etc/resolve.conf accordingly.;0
This enables you to update and add new packages to GParted.;1
Its functions and features are not computationally intensive.;1
It does not require a powerful processor or graphics card, much RAM, or disk space, for both the install and Live version, and the program loads and runs fairly quick.;1
It is obvious that when you deal with partition changes, you could lose all your data by human or application error.;0
GParted comes with absolute no warranty and cannot be made responsible for any loss of data.;0
 5.3 Security Requirements GParted Live does not deal with any security or privacy issues, as it does not run from within an operating system.;0
Every user has administrator rights and full access which are given from the start of the program, as you are logged in as root.;1
5.4 Software Quality Attributes The application provides a quite friendly user interface with its operations accessible from the menu bar and the main toolbar.;0
Software Requirements Specification For Get Real Website The software described in this document is the httQ:[[getreal.ous.edu website and associated support pages.;0

These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements speci?cations, use case documents, or a vision and scope document.;0
Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or ocation.;0
"Consider a CS minor"" section could provide helpful in ormation. Oregon High school students from several schools and classes were interviewed to gain their feedback on version 1 of the Get Real site.";0
Common thelmes elmerged in the need to change/update overall site graphic design and rea peop e. Students who are not generally interested in CS, suggested graphic design changes, more white space, pictures, and easier to navigate pages.;1
This group was much less tolerant of the site than the CS folks had been.;0
"They wanted a site that ?spoke to them"" and felt that if you were not a computer science student, it had very little to offer.";0
The suggestion was very strong that the site be broken into more readable chunks of information.;0
"The term ?walls of text"" appeared several times.";0
The need for more visually attractive information also was a central theme.;0
They wanted color, photos, diagrams, charts, etc.;0
to break up the text and make the site attractive.;0
Many of them commented positively on the spinning globe and satellite menu. Students who are interested in CS and engineering suggested changes in the Real People, Resources, and Colleges sections.;1
Most of them spent their time in the college comparison chart, and in the real people part of the site.;1
Several commented positively on the sections in each person?s story.;0
One example used on the engineergirl.org site uses an interactive table menu for more detailed information, leaving the main pages short and to the point.;0
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience.;0
Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.;0
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the favored user classes from those who are less important to satisfy.;0
> 2.4 Operating Environment The Get Real site runs as an extension of the OUS site e.g. ~getrea|.ous.edu~ Being part of the OUS domain will maximize Google and other search engine hits.;0
The site runs on OSU servers. 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints Constraints for the website include:;0
Space Bandwidth for video streaming Limited availability of Chancellor?s Office resources 2.6 User Documentation;1
There are no user documents. 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies There are no development assumptions or dependencies. 3.;0

This section provides more detailed information about each web page. 3.1 Exploring College (existing);0
A people section outlining recent CS graduates and more experienced professionals in CS and related careers.;1
A key point is to show real people using their CS knowledge in diverse fields, and not cooped up in a cubicle. Students are interested in two groups of professionals, recent grads, and experienced professionals.;1
A list of focused questions and answers with links inside the Get Real site. topics include: money, people, and colleges. Page 6 0f10 So?ware Requirements Specification for Get Real Website Page 7 3.7 Articles (existing);1
A list of articles outside the Get Real site including ?50 best jobs in America, Dream Jobs 2007, etc. 3.8 High School Courses (new);1
The intent of this section is to show recommended curricula for high school students interested in CS and related careers.;0
This page should provide pointers to curricula recommendations from OUS campuses and other university sources.;0
The ACM has recommended curricula for HS CS students. >UO is working on this area, no other campus has recommended HS courses 3.9 Search for additional information (new);0
At least two kinds of searches are needed, 1) internal search of the Get Real site, and 2) external search of CS related outside sites such as OUS campuses, articles on CS etc.;0
Google, for example provides tools for internal and external searches.;0
The Get Real prototype index page ~getrea|.ous.edu/protoindex.htm| has examples of various search engines. 3.10 Professional Organizations (new);1
This feature requires X hours per week of web design resource for editing the URLs to the DSS feed. 3.12 Ask a Grad or Prof ? FAQ (new) Get fast feedback from the Oregon University System on questions asked in a Q and A format.;1
Answers are posted in an FAQ section for all to read.;0
A Grad or Prof BLOG on CS careers would also work here. 3.13 Consider a CS Minor (new) Information for students in medicine, law, business, and other professions to provide students visibility of the high value of having a CS minor.;1
There are no special communication interface requirements 5.;1
Other Nonfunctional Requirements 5.1 Performance Requirements The Get Real site should be hosted on a server that can provide adequate response time.;0
High school students tend to have short attentions spans, so a slow server would not be satisfactory for this application.;0
The current OUS (www.ous.edu) site is a good example of rapid response time. 5.2 Security Requirements gopsyright and other security measures for Get Real should be the same as the U site. 5.3;0
"There is a need to track and evaluate the ?hits? and time spent on the student-focused website over time; and make content, design, and navigation changes as needed based on evaluation of hits.";0
Some to consider are: adaptability, availability, correctness, ?exibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, and usability.;1
5.3 Software Quality Attributes Web design conventions should be consistent with the standards and conventions used on the OUS site.;0
Write these to be speci?c, quantitative, and veri?able when possible.;0
At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, such as ease of use over ease of learning.;0
Get Real Version 3 Suggestions 6.1 Knowledge base Appendix A: Glossary Appendix B: Analysis Models <;0

This document is based on information found in the following documents: 1 ? 1 Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification ??;0
A method of allocation resources that works using both access method and access privileges.;0
For example, the Telescope Operator may be able to issue direct commands to the TCS, even while the TCS is under the control of a planned observing program.;0
An on?site observer might have privileges that allow the monitoring of systems that are allocated to others.;0
Any compression algorithm that results in the loss of original data (resolu? tion) after uncompression.;0
Typical compression savings from these algo? rithms depend upon the amount of data loss that is acceptable, but can exceed 99%.;0
A software protocol where subsystems acknowledge acceptance of a com? mand.;0
Unlike ACK/NAK, handshaking acknowledges acceptance of the message contents. High?level Operations Software Instrument Control Software Input/Output Control;0

Administrators are responsible for high?level functional control of I the Gemini system as an integrated system.;0
They work With other users to determine appropriate observation scheduling changes.;0
It is possible that a particular individual would fall into several of the I categories.;1
it is not unusual for the astronomer to also be the science observer. 2.2 OPERATIONAL LEVELS;1
Access to the system is restricted according to the current level of operation.;0

USERS OF THE SYSTEM GEM1N| 8M TELESCOPES ENCLOSURE C .;0
This is the access used for direct control of the telescope and instruments. typically during observation level operation.;1
It is normally available only to the Telescope Operator and the science program sequencer when at operation level. D .;1
Access to the Gemini system is provided during science planning.;1
Actual access to the telescope is not permitted in this mode.;1
Test access allows full.;0
All features of the sub? system are available in this mode.;0
Under no circumstances should testing affect the per? formance of an ongoing observation. F .Adminislmlive.;0
It is possible to inquire about system utilization.;0
No control is available in this mode.;0
only status and scheduling information is accessible.;0
Under no circumstances should administrative access affect the performance of an ongoing observation.;0
It is entirely possible for a single user to be accessing the system through several modes simultaneously.;0
who is often concurrently accessing the system through the observer.;0
There are times when an astronomer might be using both observer and monitor modes. 2.4 LOCATIONS OF USERS OF THE SYSTEM Users of the system will be located at one or more facilities.;0
These are referred to in gen? eral as Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities.;0
The Gemini 8m Telescopes enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility are referred to collectively as the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.;1
This is the enclosure housing the telescope.;0
In general such use would be limited to main? tenance and engineering.;0
8m Telescopes Control Facility;0
This is the facility collocated with the enclosure.;1
This is the facility where off duty personnel reside while stationed on the summit.;1
This would be the Hale Pohaku facility on Mauna Kea and Cerro Tololo in Chile (assuming no support facility is constructed on Cerro Pachon).;1

This is the facility where of?ces.;0
On Hawaii this would be with the J ACH in Hilo and in Chile it would be either the La Serena or Cerro Tololo facilities. | 2.4.5;0
Gemini 8m Telescopes Remote Operations Facility;0
These are super sites.;0
which have direct links to the telescopes Via communications lines.;0
They may or may not be collocated with any administrative organization associated with the Gemini telescopes.;1
These sites have remote operations capability. 2.4.6 Satellite Site Facility;1
These are sites with high bandwidth connections to the super sites.;1
They have remote operations capability but at a reduced level. Will these high bandwidth connections be private or public: or doesn?t it matter?;1
I don?t understand the different between a remote operations facility and a satellite site.;0
Why does the satellite site not just connect directly to the telescope?;0
Although they have remote operations capability.;0
A voice communication link, compressed digitized video link, FAX, and the ability to log in and examine the status ?les and observing logs.;1

ability to monitor all subsystems as needed. Must allow full access to all subsystems. Observing.;0
user interfaces for different access leV? els should be uniform across all subsystems.;0
all requirements and modes presented are;0
I intended to be available to all users of the system.;0
It should also be noted that what the system has to guarantee in terms of operations must ful?ll all possible requirements.;0
The available capabilities will have to be adapted to the operational needs both locally and remotely and these decisions can only be taken later in the life of the project.;0
2.5.9.1 ASTRONOMERS AND OBSERVERS De?nition;0
Observing astronomers are the end users of the system.;0
They range greatly in experi? ence from occasional users of the system to very experienced users such as staff I astronomers at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site and service observers. Purpose of work Whatever their level of experience.;1
observing astronomers will wish to concentrate I on the ef?cient acquisition of astronomical data and on?line assessment of data qual? ity.;0
the system must offer to a user an interface which.;0
while ful?lling the various operational requirements in the different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at any required level.;0
‚ Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification ? August 18, 1994 9:39 am AugusT 18, 1994 9:39 am GENERAL DESCRIPTION USER-LEVEL REQ UIREMENTS USERS OF THE SYSTEM;1
Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope is concerned.;0
They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time.;1
The intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to estab? lish a single point of control and responsibility.;1
This would allow the observer to cre? ate an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount.;1
Astronomers are typically given control access to instruments. however. Operation mode Traditional interactive operation shall normally be replaced by operation Via an automatic sequencer.;1
This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing and ?exible scheduling (as de?ned later in Section 2.7 on page 2?12).;0
A certain degree of interaction shall be provided.;0
It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue.;0
e.g. as a result of the quality assessment of previous data.;0
Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation.;0
It is eVident that.;0
However each instance of such a function should be examined as a candidate for automation ? such as focussing.;0
The existence of the scheduling queue shall be transparent to the on?site observer during the initial phases of telescope operation.;0
Only after experience has been gained with the system will the existence of the queue become eVident to the on site observer.;0
2.5.9.2 OPERATIONS STAFF De?nition;0
Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes.;1
These users will be very experienced users of the system.;1
They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to adVise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments ef?ciently.;1
They shall also monitor general performance and system safety. Privileges Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance pro? cedures in case of problems.;1
This includes direct control of physical units. However.;1
If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate recon?guration;0
At the present time it is not clear how to handle Visitor instrument requirements in this area.;0
"These users will have a deep understanding of the way the Gemini 8m Telescopes software works. Purpose of work; Software development and maintenance staff intervene when there is a major prob? lem to be solved or an upgrade to be installed.";0
They also perform system generation and installation of new software packages or new releases.;0
Other parts of the Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode to support integration tests.;0
This means that a number of commands are available which allow the hardware concerned to be tested (test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers. 2.6 OPERATIONAL CONTEXT;1
This section derives directly from Gemini 8m Telescopes program requirements and spec? i?es the operational context.;1
which is a direct consequence of the structure of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system.;0
The Gemini 8m Telescopes operation has to cope with a complex environment produced by: 0 multi?telescope concept 0 multi?instrument context 0;0
Visitor instrument context 0 multi?user context. 2.6.1 Multi-telescope context;0
Although there are two telescopes as part of the Gemini system there are no plans to sup? port concurrent use of them as if they were a single facility.;0
The Gemini 8m Telescopes are thus characterized all the time as in a multi?instru? ment context. Parallel access to all the mounted instruments shall be provided.;1
Feeding two separate instruments Via beam splitters or ?eld splitters and providing separate control nodes is not a requirement.;1
Regardless of the status of an inactive instrument.;0
The requirement to provide for support.;0
Due to the specialized nature of Visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that complete integration into the Gemini environment is either feasible or warranted.;0
In this case a subset of the available functionality must be made available through a standardized interface.;0
The Gemini Telescopes View all instruments as operating as servers.;0
Visitor instruments must be capable of operating in this mode to be adequately supported.;0
It should be the goal of this interface that it be a subset of the existing instrumentation interface (rather than a separate system).;0
At a minimum this interface should support: I 0 acquisition of status information of instrument by other systems 0 capability to enter preprogrammed observing sequences 0 capability to offset the telescope position and focus;1
om AugusT 18, 1994 9:39 am GENERAL DESCRIPTION OPERATIONAL CONTEXT VISlTOR INSTRUMENT CONTEXT;0
Due to the nature of Visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that more complicated function? ality can be supported.;0
In particular coordinated motions of the Gemini system compo? nents with those of the Visitor instrument (other than simple raster scans) will not be supported.;0
This does not mean that more complicated functionality will not be possible for Visitor instruments that require it.;0
Such functionality will not be offered as a standard service but will require a joint effort on the part of Gemini and the Visitor instrument team.;0
As more complicated functionality will be supported Via standardized interfaces for the Gemini instruments.;0
such as coordinated motions.;0
The dif?culty with offering such services as an externally sup? ported standard.;0
It is important that the Visitor instrument interface be stable and long?lived.;1
The support of Visitor instrumentation is made simpler if the Visitor equipment adheres to the Gemini standards.;1
It is much better to establish a subset of Gemini facilities which will be made available to Visitor instruments Via long lived.;1
Visitor requirements outside of these would be handled on an as needed basis.;0
The support of both Gemini and Visitor instruments would bene?t by the provision of a Gemini observatory simulator.;0
The requirements to have instruments operated as single units imply that several user stations will be active at the same time on the Gemini 8m Telescopes.;0
In other words. any subsection of the whole Gemini 8m Telescopes system should be accessible and controllable from any single point (but of course with protection ensuring security and safety).;1
A particularly simple case of multi?use of the system is multi?point monitoring.;0
By this it is meant that.;0
while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Tele? scopes.;0
someone else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and instruments.;0
This will typically be needed by the operation supervisor.;0
All other users wishing to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by Operations and get permission to do so.;0
The multi?point monitoring mode might also be important when certain dif?cult or rare problems occur.;0
when expert adVice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely.;0
Normally executed with the sequencer by providing a computer executable program.;0
in order to make ef?cient use of the Gemini telescope. B .;0
Interactive operation is supported.;0
but always through the Observatory Control System (OCS). C .;0
There is a Visual user interface to the OCS to allow for changes to the Viewing program. D .;0
It is possible to have more than one station participate in the observing.;0
Interactive observing with time allocation for full nights is a ?rst basic requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes.;0
It is therefore an essential requirement that telescope operation is supported by the software in a smooth and very friendly way in this mode. Interaction will normally be Via an automatic sequencer (see Section 2.5.9 on page 2?6).;1
This is clearly a top priority requirement and one which will have to be realized before implementing any other mode.;0
While its requirements include all those given below for service observing. it has the following special requirements.;0
The observing program must be fully automated. requiring very little human interaction during the observation.;0
The means that the Gemini software must include a suf?ciently rich programming environment to make this feasible.;0
this should be a Visu? ally?oriented environment providing a simple.;0
There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer to test observing pro? grams for completeness.;0
This simulator should function within the Virtual telescope environment of the Gemini system. C .;0
All control software must provide support for simulated use within the Virtual telescope. D .;0
There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both within an observing program and across observing programs.;0
This software must consider target positions.;0
weather conditions. and instrument con?gura? tions. August 18, 1994 9:39 am Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification 2 ? 13 2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS Remote operoTions E .;0
There must be software to support the ?exible scheduling.;0
To maximize the use of the available observing time it must be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the currently available instruments.;1
These would be in the form of preprogrammed observing sequences.;1
It should be possible to resort the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front of the queue.;1
This sorting will be based on properties of the individual observing sequences. current site conditions.;1
Thus queue scheduling is a superset of preprogrammed observing. with similar I requirements.;1
As the costs of implementing such a scheduler are currently dif?cult to estimate it may prove necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project.;1
It also covers remote eavesdropping.;0
(There will always be support staff on?site during observations. however.);0
The requirements for supporting remote operations are:;0
All software should be developed to permit remote operations.;1
There should be no conceptual difference between software working on?site and remotely. I B .;0
All observing facilities should work both on?site and off?site.;1
It should be possible to do full operations remotely. C .;1
It must be possible to restrict speci?c operations to speci?c remote sites.;1
For exam? ple.;0
The method used to restrict such operations should be independent of the operations themselves. and dynamic. 2 ? 14 Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification ? August 18, 1994 9:39;0
However. we will take advantage of commercially available protocols such as ISDN. TCP/IP. Internet.;0
The choice of the name remote operations is meant to suggest an entire category of opera? tions.;0
In this sense it is more general than pure remote observing.;0
Despite the obvious limitations introduced by the link bandwidths available at the differ? ent locations.;0
It is only nec? essary that the functionality of the system be transparent.;0
it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system.;0
However the system design should minimize the impact of link bandwidth on transparency. Security of operation shall be considered and might imply different operation levels and privileges at different sites.;1
It is required that the remote operations software be considered from the beginning in the Gemini 8m Telescopes software design.;0
This should reduce the amount of speci?c software needed for remote operations.;0
The philosophy behind this is that.;0
OBSERVING Remote observing means that users shall be able to observe from a remote site such as Cerro Tololo.;0
This possibility has to be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes.;0
The extent to which realistic observing conditions can be reproduced depends.;0
Experience with previous telescopes at other Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification 2 ? 15 2 ? 16 Gemini Software GENERAL DESCRIPTION OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS Remote operoTions observatories shows.;0
It is a requirement for the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation and will complement service observing. making it friendlier for users.;1
Remote monitoring coincides to a large extent with multipoint monitoring.;1
There is no requirement that the remote screen be a duplicate of the local screen.;1
The remote key? board will have no effect on the local user's environment.;0
A remote observer might also need a real?time Video and voice link with the operator in the control room.;0
perhaps using a portable Video camera which the operator can position as necessary.;0
It is assumed this facility is provided entirely by hardware.;0
This might be necessary to back up local users expertise and to help in case of problems.;0
Distributed access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software.;0
A special case of service observing.;0
where a science observer is present on site and the client astronomer is remotely connected. is considered here.;0
The requirements speci?c to service observing are: .;1
The observing program must be automated. requiring little human interaction during the observation.;1
The means that the Gemini software must include a suf?ciently rich pro? gramming environment to make this feasible.;1
This programming environment should be available both to the astronomer.;1
This access may or may not be done concurrently on a shared environment. C .;1
The programming environment should allow for the communication of special notes. instructions. and comments from the astronomer to the observer.;1
The use of this feature would.;1
But interactive observing is perhaps.;0
It will be done on his behalf at a conve? nient moment that is not exactly prede?ned and may be intermixed with programs from other users.;0
Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification 2 ? 17 GENERAL DESCRIPTION;0
OBSERVING SUPPORT Planned Observing Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments.;0
This might typically be a few times (2) per night.;0
when sky conditions change.;0
It requires also that the observing program is so well speci?ed that it can be executed by someone else.;0
For these reasons it can only be applied to the Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been ful?lled and been in operation for a while.;0
which still requires compe? tent monitoring at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or remotely. At the same time.;0
one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra ?exibility of ground?based astronomy.;0
So whichever scheme is adopted to perform automatic sequences.;0
only on error conditions. any time the user is allowed to break a sequence.;0
It will require the use of service and/or remote observing.;0
This can be comple? So?wore Requirements Specification ? August 18, 1994 9:39 om GENERAL DESCRIPTION GENERAL SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS CONTROL INFORMATION FLOW mented by remote monitoring.;0
Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling quickly. exchanging observing programs.;0
This can be achieved only with the help of appropriate scheduling software.;1
which must adVise the operations team on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the various observing programs.;0
Thus ?exible scheduling is a superset of queue scheduling.;0
These requirements apply to the commands and replies between sub?systems (including status information requests and replies).;0

The syntax of control ?ow commands is to be consistent across the system.;0

Analysis Models GAM MA?J Web Store Appendix D: Issues List 1.;0
Currently, telephonic orders are a significant source of business at Gamma-J which is both expensive and labor extensive.;0
The organization has to ?gure out a way to have a smooth transition of orders coming in through telephones to the new online ordering system without loosing business to the competitor. 2.;0
Gamma-J depends mainly on Fed-Ex for its tracking number and transportation needs to ship the orders.;0
GOG Software Requirements Specification;0
This is the Software Requirement Specification for GOG, which describes in detail the objec- tives of the software simulator and the requirements to be considered on its design and con- struction.;0
It will use error models to provide rapid simulations of large amount of data.;0
The realism of the simulations depends on the realism of the available error models.;0
The schema shown in figure 1 depicts from a high level perspective where GOG will produce its data on the overall current data flow for Gaia:;0
The implementation of the instrumental error models is planned to be a gradual process that will be based on the study of the detailed pixel-level simulated data produced by GIBIS.;0
The simulation of processed data requires models of the calibration errors that will be provided by the CUs in charge of the calibration algorithms development.;0
In order to simulate data at a pre- cise step of the processing, the addition of the calibration errors is planned to be user-selectable.;0
The output format of GOG simulated data will be according to the Interface Control Document for the Gaia Main database (GAIA-C3-SP-ESAC-JH-002 in preparation).;0
Note that some of the steps and options described here will have to be revised when the actual ICD will be available.;0
GOG is expected to be in continuous evolution depending on the availability of the error mod- els.;0
To allow satisfying all the needs to access specific data, GOG will be entirely modular and configurable through an input configuration file.;0
For the source generation, 2 main options will be available:;0
1. Generation of the data from the Universe model of the GaiaSimu library: the user will specify a sky region (e.g. an HTM, square, circle).;1
Note that the relative positions of the sources with each other will not be used by GOG to add overlapping effects, GOG only works source by source.;0
Only the density at the source position could be used to adjust the error models (if they are provided as a function of density).;0
The user can ask for only one typical epoch data or for all the transits of the source.;0
Two main types of noises will be simulated: 1. Instrumental noise: noise that will come from the observation process, e.g. on-board detection and tracking or observation dead-time. 2. Reduction noise:;1
This will depend on the availability of the models.;0
Note that GOG aim will not be to produce raw data but pre-processed data;0
The following requirements have been capture thinking on a GOG generic operational;0
At this stage some spectations for GOG might changed.;0
The main hurdle GOG has, is that the contents of the main database are not fully completed. For this reason the initial versions of Gog will consider the current specifications and will be based on the restrictions described in section 11.;1
On this overview we see GOG as a unique software product.;0
From the high level perspective it can be decomposed on the SADT diagram as follows:;0
FIGURE 2: GOG general i/o context diagram Exploding the central box, looking one level deeper, we could distinguish the following main blocks of execution.;0
The following pictures shows how the problem is depicted. 2.2 Decomposition;0
According to TL-001 a ?Software Product? is composed of several ?Modules?.;0
In this section we describe how the system is logically decomposed and mention the modules which will appear from Sect. 3 onward and how they interact. GOG as a software product can be decomposed in software modules.;0
We have identified the following main conceptual modules;0
This is for high level requirements which apply to all modules.;0
These requirements may be removed from this document and appear in a higher level requirements document for CU2or at the DPC level.;0
That is, it will use as other the other simulators the Gaia Simu library and the Gaia Tools library.;0
For source generation GOG has 2 main options available: Universe Model from GaiaSimu or a Object Input Catalogue GOG has a source by source processing mechanism GOG must consider noise effects.;1
For noise generation those effects should be user- selectable (they can be added or not and the values should be given by users).We classify noises in two groups:;1

These requirements are not limited to any industry sector.;0
The approach provides a common ?Ianguage? for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts.;0
This speci?cation does not include the XML schema to be used.;0
"No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ?black boxes?.";0
The following aspects of procurement are out of scope: 0 Seller discovery.;0
"0 e-tendering; 0 negotiation of terms and conditions of trade.";0
0 communication with third parties and intermediaries e.g.;0
carriers, banks and fiscal authorities.;0
0 message transport and security.;0
0 data protection and retention rules.;0
0 the application of public sector purchasing policy.;0
In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.;1
Such an incremental approach demands that all Documents (those adopted earlier and later) represent the same things in a common way.;0
These requirements support several Government initiatives, including.;0
The greatest bene?ts accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re-keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.;1
One example is the ?three-way match? between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.;0
Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer?s back office.;0
Cross?Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).;0
This specification provides a clear ?stake in the ground? for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.;0
Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple specifications.;0
Aworking group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.;0
These requirements have been re?ned through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.;0
"The method used is based on the OeE?s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF); see www.qovtalk.qov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.asp.";0
The scope for this speci?cation is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.;0
This broad domain is broken down into four main business processes.;0
Sourcing includes activity prior to placing a formal order, including the exchange of Catalogue information, Requests For Quotation (RFQ) and Quotations.;0
Ordering includes Purchase Orders and responses.;0
Fulfilment includes delivery/despatch noti?cation, receipt (including variances) and Seller's proposed recti?cation of any problems.;1
Accounting includes Invoices (including Self Billed Invoices) Credit Notes, Debit Notes, Statements and Remittance Advice.;1
Each business process involves the exchange of information between the Buyer and the Seller, using a number of Documents.;1
Documents Produced in Each Business Process.;1
Sourcing Request for Quotation Catalogue.;1
Ordering Purchase Order Purchase Order Response.;1
Fulfilment Receipt Advice Ful?lment Notification.;1
Recti?cation Advice.;1
Accounting Self Billed Invoice Invoice.;1
Debit Note Credit Note.;1
Remittance Advice Statement.;1
The Documents included are: Catalogue RFQ (Request for Quotation) Quotation is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to provide Item price and other information for use in locally held Catalogues.;0
Is a request from the Buyer to the Seller to quote terms and conditions under which the Seller is willing to supply speci?c goods or services.;0
The Documents included are: Purchase Order PO Res ponse 2.1.3 Fulfilment is sent by the Buyer to tell the Seller that the sender wishes to purchase goods and/or services.;0
It is a promise to buy.;0
Variants may support revision or cancellation of the Purchase Order either in content (Items ordered or quantity of Items) and/or in terms of fulfilment (changed delivery details, required by date etc).;0
|t acknowledges that the Purchase Order has been received and that it will be ful?lled in total, in part or not at all.;0
It may also give additional information about specific delivery.;0
The Documents included are: Fulfilment Notification is sent by the Seller to tell the Buyer that goods have been despatched or delivered or that a service has been performed.;0
The Seller may use this Document to notify the Buyer of shipping details via a third party carrier and to notify partial or complete delivery of a Purchase Order.;0
Receipt Advice is sent by the Buyer to the Seller to acknowledge receipt in full or in part and to describe discovered variances e.g.;0
un-noti?ed under?delivery, over?delivery, wrong Items delivered or damaged goods.;0
Rectification Advice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to tell the Buyer of action to be taken regarding the goods or services at variance from the actual requirement e.g.;0
the Seller may ask the Buyer to return the goods, await collection of the goods (by the Seller or his carrier) or destroy the goods.;0
2.1.4 Accounting The Documents included are: Invoice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to request payment for goods delivered or services performed.;0
Invoice is a Value Added Tax (VAT) Document.;1
Self Billed Invoice is an Invoice sent from the Buyer to the Seller where the two have a self billing arrangement.;0
For more information regarding HMCE requirements for self billing, see WWW.hmce.qov.uk/forms/notices/700-62.htm Self Billed Invoice is a VAT Document.;0
Credit Note is sent from the Seller to the Buyer, confirming that the Seller owes money to the Buyer.;0
It may be used to rectify errors and/or variances in the invoicing process.;0
Credit Note is a VAT Document.;1
Debit Note is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, stating that Buyer has deducted amounts from a Seller?s Invoice.;0
A Debit Note precludes the need for a Seller to raise a Credit Note.;1
Debit Note is a VAT Document.;0
Remittance Advice is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, notifying payment and stating what Invoices, Credit and Debit Notes have been accounted for.;0
Statement is sent from the Seller to the Buyer summarising the status of the Buyer?s account and the Invoices, Remittances, Debit and Credit Notes submitted within a speci?c time period.;0
2.2 Parties A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives goods, services or information.;0
A role is a job done by a particular Party.;1
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.;0
Every Document has a sender and receiver, one of which is a Buyer role, the other a Seller role.;0
The Party types, ro|es names and Documents sent and received are shown in Table 2.;0
Seller ro|es include: Sales Point Despatch Point Customer Service Accounts Receivable is responsible for the arrangement and maintenance of trading agreements with suppliers, including Catalogue data.;1
"The Purchasing Manager is not involved in other transactions; if the Purchasing Manager requests or makes a purchase, that individual adopts the role of Originator or Order Point respectively.";1
If Originator subsequently places a Purchase Order, the Originator adopts the role of Order Point.;0
Purchase Card (credit or debit card) information may be associated with the Order Point.;0
It may include Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information i.e.;0
Note: Messages to and from banks are out of scope.;0
Note: Messages to and from carriers are out of scope.;0
2.3 Codes and Identifiers Semantic interoperability depends on the ability of computers to match identi?ers and codes.;0
0 Documents and Lines need to be referenced in subsequent transactions in the procurement cycle.;1
0 internal instance identifiers may be used to avoid repetition of the same set of information many times within the same Document e.g.;1
Delivery Point.;0
0 Parties need to be identi?ed for fiscal purposes (VAT No., Company Registration No.;1
0 Documents need to be uniquely identifiable for audit purposes.;1
0 Items are classified for management information e.g.;1
commodity classification, and identi?ed at individual or Catalogue |tem level as appropriate.;0
The identi?ers, coding and classification schemes used in this specification fall into five groups: International used and maintained internationally, including: 0 country codes (ISO 3166).;0
National used and maintained nationally, including the OeE Government.;0
Data Standards Catalogue (GDSC).;0
Examples include: 0 Company registration number.;0
Speci?ed in this developed for this speci?cation including: Document 0 Document status 0 payment method Application-speci?c a variety of application-speci?c identification schemes are supported.;1
These include: 0 Seller reference for Buyer.;0
0 Buyer reference for Seller.;1
0 locally specified identifiers for instances of: o Quotation.;1
Because, such schemes are application-speci?c they can never be relied on to be 100% unique.;0
Universally Unique Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is an instance identifier Identi?ers generated on the fly as speci?ed in ISO 11587.;0
It is also known as a Globally Unique Identi?er (GUID).;0
UUID is a 128 bit string usua||y formatted as 32 characters alphanumeric.;0
In this specification UUID is used for matching instances of Document and Line between Documents and for referring to multiple ro|e instances of the same Party within a single Document.;1
UUIDs provide an effective means to ensure exact matching of identifiers at machine level, but are not well suited to visual matching, which is why existing ID data are also required.;1
The descriptions are illustrated with UML class diagrams.;0
A specialisation inherits all of the properties of its parent class.;0
Some knowledge of UML is needed to understand the model fully, but the text is intended to be understandable to those who are not familiar with the UML notation.;0
contains information about each Party including organisation and person details, postal and electronic addresses.;0
A sender and a receiver are included in every Document.;0
3.2 Party A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives information, goods or services.;0
A role is a job done by a particular Party.;1
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.;1
Figure 2. shows the common elements of Party.;0
Direct Line is a universally unique identifier for an instance of Party.;0
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.;0
The full details of any Party only need to be provided once and other occurences of the same Party may be cross-referenced using Party UUID.;1
Unstructured name is typically entered manua||y at the time of the transaction.;0
Address may be unstructured or structured.;0
When an unstructured address is used, it must have 1 to 5 Lines.;0
The UK Post Code is a combination of between five and seven letters and numbers which define four different levels of geographic unit.;0
Although Post Code cannot be made mandatory in all circumstances, it should be present if known.;0
This needs to be coded to enable collection of management data on source of imports and exports.;0
For companies registered in England and Wales, this is the company Registration Number issued by Companies House, Cardiff.;0
VAT Identifier includes Country Code (as above) and VAT number.;0
It is a specific Internet identifier that contains a locally interpreted string followed by the ?at? sign (@) followed by an Internet domain.;0
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.;0
Where an industrial estate contains streets it is defined as a locality in its own right.;0
UK |nterna| Code is used if the Country Code is GB.;0
"3.2.3 Extended Electronic Address eAddress XE ""URL""eAddress Channel eAddress Use is the number or string of the electronic address or telephone number.";1
3.2.4 Person Structured Name Title Forename Surname Name Suffix Job Title Department Known As is an individual?s address tit|e e.g.;1
Mr, Ms, Dr. is an individual?s forename or first name.;0
3.2.5 Party Specialisations Figure 3.;0
Party Specialisations and Attributes Preferred Payment is the Seller?s preferred method of payment e.g BACS or Method Purchase Card.;0
Account Name is the name of the organisation?s bank account.;0
Branch ID is the Sort Code of the bank branch.;0
Bank Name is the name of the bank.;0
SWIFT Code is the bank code allocated by the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SVVI FT).;0
3.3 Document Document is the main container for information sent from a sender to a recipient.;0
All Documents have two or more Parties and one or more Lines.;1
A single Line contains information about one |tem.;1
Each Document is identified with a Document identifier, date and status e.g.;0
original, copy or test and includes details of the sender and intended recipient as well as metadata (information about the Document itself).;0
Linkage at the Line level between Documents allows a many-to-many relationship between Documents such as Purchase Order and Invoice.;0
If the original Document is revised, it may keep the original Document ID, but the Document status and UUID will be different.;0

XML extensible Markup Language.;1
These requirements are not limited to any industry sector.;0
The approach provides a common ?Ianguage? for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts.;0
This speci?cation does not include the XML schema to be used.;0
"No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ?black boxes?.";0
"carriers, banks and fiscal authorities; - message transport and security; - data protection and retention rules; - the application of public sector purchasing policy.";0
eProcurement is a many-to-many electronic data interchange (EDI) problem on a large scale and requires both the sender and the receiver to interpret each and every data element in precisely the same way.;0
In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.;0
Such an incremental approach demands that all Documents (those adopted earlier and later) represent the same things in a common way.;0
"0 Note: for a revision, the whole Document may need to be re-issued and manual intervention may be required; ?cancellation? o cancellation of original Document in its entirety.";0
1.2 Benefits These requirements support several Government initiatives, including: .;0
The greatest benefits accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re- keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.;0
One example is the ?three-way match? between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.;0
Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer?s back of?ce.;0
Cross-Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium- sized enterprises (SMEs).;0
This speci?cation provides a clear ?stake in the ground? for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.;0
Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple speci?cations.;0
A working group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.;0
These requirements have been re?ned through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.;0
"The method used is based on the OeE?s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF); see www.qovtalk.gov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.as|o.";0
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with UML.;0
- classes are colour coded for convenience, with colours indicating the parent Package of each class: 0 Party pink 0 Document cyan 0 Line green 0 Item purple.;1
chapter 3 of this specification covers common classes which are re-used in more than one Document.;0
- chapter 4 covers individual Document speci?cations.;0
For this reason, each Document specification description contains only descriptions of the attributes that are specific to that Document.;0
All other elements are optional, although some may be required to support certain business processes.;0
The scope for this specification is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.;0
Ordering includes Purchase Orders and responses.;0
Ful?lment includes delivery/despatch notification, receipt (including variances) and Seller's proposed rectification of any problems.;0
Accounting includes Invoices (including Self Billed Invoices) Credit Notes, Debit Notes, Statements and Remittance Advice.;0
2.1 Interactions Each business process involves the exchange of information between the Buyer and the Seller, using a number of Documents (see Table 1).;0
RFQ is a request from the Buyer to the Seller to quote terms and conditions (Request for Quotation) under which the Seller is willing to supply specific goods or services.;0
2.1.2 Ordering The Documents included are: Purchase Order is sent by the Buyer to tell the Seller that the sender wishes to purchase goods and/or services.;1
|t acknowledges that the Purchase Order has been received and that it will be fulfilled in total, in part or not at all.;1
It may also give additional information about specific delivery.;1
The Seller may use this Document to notify the Buyer of shipping details via a third party carrier and to notify partial or complete delivery of a Purchase Order.;1
Invoice is a Value Added Tax (VAT) Document.;1
For more information regarding HMCE requirements for self billing, see www.hmce.qov.uk/forms/notices/700-62.htm Self Billed Invoice is a VAT Document.;1
Credit Note is a VAT Document.;1
A Debit Note precludes the need for a Sellerto raise a Credit Note.;1
Debit Note is a VAT Document.;1
2.2 Parties A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives goods, services or information.;0
A role is a job done by a particular Party.;1
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.;1
Every Document has a sender and receiver, one of which is a Buyer role, the other a Seller role.;0
The Party types, ro|es names and Documents sent and received are shown in Table 2.;0
"The Purchasing Manager is not involved in other transactions; if the Purchasing Manager requests or makes a purchase, that individual adopts the role of Originator or Order Point respectively.";1
Originator also known as requisitioner, has the original demand for each Item of goods and/or services.;0
If Originator subsequently places a Purchase Order, the Originator adopts the role of Order Point.;0
Order Point raises Purchase Order.;0
Purchase Card (credit or debit card) information may be associated with the Order Point.;0
Delivery Point also known as goods inwards, is where the goods or services are delivered and variances in receipt are identified.;0
Accounts Payable also known as accounts payable, is responsible for Invoice processing and payment and, in some circumstances, the issuing of Self Billed Invoices.;0
2.2.2 Seller Roles Seller ro|es include: Sales Point the acceptance of a Purchase Order.;0
Despatch Point performance of services.;1
Accounts Receivable is responsible for invoicing and credit control.;1
It may include Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information i.e.;1
2.2.3 Third Party Roles Third Party ro|es include: Carrier is assigned by the Seller or the Buyer to deliver or return goods.;0
commodity classi?cation, and identi?ed at individual or Catalogue |tem level as appropriate.;1
Examples include: 0 Company registration number .;1
VAT reference number Specified in this developed for this speci?cation including: Document .;1
Seller reference for Buyer 0 Buyer reference for Seller locally specified identifiers for instances of: 0 Quotation Purchase Order Ful?lment Notification Invoice other document identifiers .;1
consignment - Item 0 0 0 0 Because, such schemes are application-specific they can never be relied on to be 100% unique.;0
Universally Unique Identi?er (UUID) is an instance identifier generated on the fly as speci?ed in ISO 11587.;0
It is also known as a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).;0
UUID is a 128 bit string usua||y formatted as 32 characters alphanumeric.;0
In this speci?cation UUID is used for matching instances of Document and Line between Documents and for referring to multiple ro|e instances of the same Party within a single Document.;0
UUIDs provide an effective means to ensure exact matching of identi?ers at machine level, but are not well suited to visual matching, which is why existing ID data are also required.;1
Each Document is made up of a common set of elements, which are described below.;0
The descriptions are illustrated with UML class diagrams.;0
A specialisation inherits all of the properties of its parent class.;0
Some knowledge of UML is needed to understand the model fully, but the text is intended to be understandable to those who are not familiar with the UML notation.;1
A sender and a receiver are included in every Document.;0

A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives information, goods or services.;0
A role is a job done by a particular Party.;0
One Party may play a number of roles in a is a universally unique identi?er for an instance of Party.;0
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.;0
The full details of any PaIty only need to be provided once and other occurences of the same PaIty may be cross-referenced using Party UUID.;0
Unstructured name is typically entered manua||y at the time of the transaction.;0
Address may be unstructured or structured.;0
When an unstructured address is used, it must have 1 to 5 Lines.;0
The UK Post Code is a combination of between five and seven letters and numbers which define four different levels of geographic unit.;0
Although Post Code cannot be made mandatory in all circumstances, it should be present if known.;0
This needs to be coded to enable collection of management data on source of imports and exports.;0
VAT Identifier includes Country Code (as above) and VAT number.;0
It is a speci?c Internet identifier that contains a locally interpreted string followed by the ?at? sign (@) followed by an Internet domain.;0

Note: for a copy, revision or cancellation, the Document date is the date of the revised Document, not the original.;0
|f value is ?true?, the Document is intended for test purposes only and does not to constitute a contractual commitment.;0
This should be the same as the value of the version attribute in the schema element of both the XML message instance and the schema.;1
This identifier is optional, but is recommended to be sent.;1
The format may be manufacturer speci?c, but could be a UUID.;1
This is used for non-structured header-Ievel Document information, which is intended to be human readable.;1
This information is should be sent if it is known to the sender.;0
This string may include details of the payment trigger event, the period between trigger event and payment and any agreed settlement terms.;0
This does not include delivery terms which may be |tem-specific.;0
In an XML Document it is recommended that the Digital Signature be the ?nal element of the payload.;0

The Quali?cation Methods applied to the software shall include test, demonstration, analysis, and inspection (T, D, A, I).;0
An example of accumulated data is the compilation of data obtained from other quali?cation methods.;0
Examples of the processing of accumulated data are interpretations or extrapolations made from the data.;0
The information / parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention.;0
It will include controls qualifying the processing involved. Business Rule:;0
A narrative description of policies, procedures, or principles within an organization.;0
Business rules can be divided in to four categories: de?nitions, facts, constraints, and derivations. De?nitions are business rules that de?ne entities and attributes.;0
They are the integrity rules that protect the data in the eventual database. Derivations are business rules that materialize a new piece of information (often attribute values) from other pieces of information.;1
For example, a mathematical derivation might specify that you can obtain a person's age by subtracting his or her birth date from the current date.;0
Commit/Rollback: An individual transaction is processed (commit) or discarded (rollback) by the proponent maintainer of the data items involved. Discretionary Access Controls (DAC):;0
A means of restricting access to obj ects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which they belong.;0
The information/parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention.;0
It will include controls qualifying the processing involved. Location Transparency: occurs when the physical location of data is transparent to the applications and users of the database system.;1
Access to an obj ect potentially implies access to the information it contains.;0
It refers to proponency at the source and record level.;0
Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID): A RAID system appears asone very large, reliable disk to the CPU.;0
The main reason for using RAID storage is its reliability.;0
RAID has the same advantages as shadowing and striping at a lower cost.;1
RAID 4 intended to overcome performance penalties of RAID 3 for small transfers.;1
RAID 5 (in which parity over RAID 3 or RAID 4 implementations), and RAID 6 ( in which two parity disks in addition to data disks are used in an attempt to further improve performance).;1
In a RAID 5 implementation, the data is stored as are check sums and other information about the contents of each disk in the array.;1
If one disk is lost, the others can use the check sums and other stored information to recreate the lost data.;0
Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level implementations to improve performance and reliability.;0
RDA de?nes a set of client and server standards and a mapping of SQL commands to these services.;0
Supports queries of spatial data where the selection criteria are de?ned by spatial attributes.;0
APPENDIX A The metadata and procedures are described for the current Information Resource Submittal Package . Metadata and Related Information;0
An XML tag may be described as any obj ect and is easily created by anyone using a text editor.;0
So far, the burgeoning sets of XML tags have created redundancy and irrelevancy, and they lack validity. XML Registry.;0
To ensure interoperability, this registry provides a baseline set of tags developed through coordination and approval among the Community.;0
The Registry allows a user to browse, search, and retrieve data that satisfy your requirements.;0
Document Type De?nition (DTD)) or existing tags, you may submit your proposed tag to a Community of Interest (C01) and provide amplifying information for all to understand the semantics for its proper use.;0
The COE Chief Engineer will approve a single Point of Contact (POC) for a COI to manage the tags within that C01.;0
Please consult the Registry for the most authoritative list of information resources types.) The FCC responsibilities will include the transitioning of information resources from one status to another.;0
Include amplifying info associated with speci?c Tag(s) Zip and attach submission package to e-mail message to: Rules and Convensions. Establishing a new Information Resource.;0
Follow these conventions for creating new information resources for the Registry;0
If the term is well recognized outside its container term, designate it as an element.;0
Example: CTRY_CD, CTRY_NM, CTRY_ABBRD_NM, CTRY_OFF_NM, CTRY_SCP_NT_TX, and CTRY_PSTL_NM are all characteristics (ER?attributes) for the entity CTRY.;0
In the relational world, they are columns within the table ctry, attributes of the entity ctry in er-modeling, and member attributes in obj ect modeling.;0
It would be expected that a submitter would identify them as attributes rather than elements.;0
But if they were identi?ed as attributes of the element ctry, then the additional baggage (other attributes) must be carried, or submitted as separate elements.;0
We wish to limit the proliferation of tags, so we strongly urge folks to use XML_Attributes sparingly. Include descriptive de?nitions AND synonyms for the Information Resource De?nition.;0
At this time such detailed information is unavailable. The Internal Interfaces for the XS SRS are de?ned as interfaces to COE components.;0
In third quarter 2004, ABC Paint will migrate to a new paint numbering scheme.;0
This migration comes at a time that ABC Paint will be adding and discontinuing a number of paints and collections.;0
For ABC Paint customers to remain loyal and happy, we will create an easy to use system, allowing conversion to the new paints and collections.;0
The new system must be in place by the second quarter of 2004, allowing customers the time to adjust to the new scheme before they will not be able to order the discontinued products.;0
The use of the application will be long-term, used for the immediate transition and in the future when previous customers may return for more paint with old-scheme numbers.;0
This stand- alone product includes features to enable ABC Paint to easily and seamlessly include the application in their current website.;0
1.2 Document Conventions Two primary typographical conventions were followed in the generation of this specification paper.;0
First, all acronyms are fully defined in their first use and then identified.;0
They are also redundantly defined in the glossary, Appendix A.;0
Any bold italicized item in the specification is also briefly defined in the Appendix A glossary.;0
You may find it helpful to review the list of documents related to the project as referenced in the references section, section 1.5, of this specification.;0
These readers will find that this document is a product specification only, not a design document.;0
It is recommended that all readers complete the introduction section before continuing onto the other sections.;0
The introduction section that you are now reading provides a broad overview of the entire project and serves as a guide to the other sections.;0
Developers will find sections two, four most useful to them while sections three and five will most likely be paid the most attention by project managers.;0
Sections two and four provide both overall descriptions of the project and the product itself.;0
Sections three and five present an outline of the product interface requirements and other non- functional or performance requirements, which the final product must meet.;0
The project manager will find these requirements most enlightening to peruse, as they will help guide decisions and performance choices throughout the entire product development process.;0
This system must enable a smooth transition to the new paint numbers and scheme.;1
The system will be designed for use as long as the hardware and operating systems specified in this document remain available.;1
The product will be highly accessible to ABC Paint clients and distributors.;1
To enable this wide access to the application, the new system will be integrated into the current ABC Paint website.;0
Each main feature of the application will be modularized.;1
Each module will fit on a single webpage.;1
The application will provide a theme and styling mechanism to allow ABC Paint web designers to integrate the application.;0
ABC Paint has made it very clear that they will make trade-offs to retain the benefits of the application being available on the web, retaining high accessibility.;0
The product is a stand-alone web application with a theme mechanism to allow easy integration of the application into the ABC Paint website.;1
The ColorKast solution is a server based application with a web-based clientfor consumer and enterprise access.;1
In some respects, the application is the next generation of the old mechanical, hand-select, palette board system located in paint stores everywhere.;0
All of these will be defined and described later in this same document.;0
The actual user interface will be described in a separate user interface specification whitepaper.;1
All references to performance or specification apply to the application client.;1
Specifications and performance estimates apply to the application server only if explicitly stated.;1
2.2 Product Functions These functions are modularized sub-components of the client application.;0
Each of the functions has a single purpose and can accomplish its mission without the other components.;1
Together, the components function as a stand-alone application.;1
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics ColorKast has identified two user classes for access to the new application.;0
The first user class is default for all users and allows no administrative functionality whatsoever.;1
The second class, the administrative user, is composed of several subclasses for the secure management of access to data and permissions throughout the organization.;1
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 4 Default: This user has access to all functionality of the application except the administrative fu nction.;1
The user data stored by this user is not password protected but is session persistent.;0
Administrative: This user is composed of three subclasses.;0
Level 3, the highest level administrative user has all access, update, add, delete permissions, and can create other administrative users at any level.;1
Level 2, has update, add permissions, and can create administrative users up to Level 2.;1
Level 1, has add permissions and can add administrative users at Level 1 only.;1
2.4 Operating Environment The proposed ColorKast Solution will be implemented in a client/server model.;0
All processing of searches and storing of information will be local to the server.;1
Client: The web-based client is compatible with most operating systems and requires a working installation of Internet Explorer 4.01, Netscape 6.0, or Mozilla 1.0 or later.;0
The client computer should match or exceed the system requirements specified for the web browser intended for use with the client application.;0
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints A few issues limit our choices when implementing a suitable solution for the ABC Paint Project.;0
It is very important that the application be web-based.;0
We understand that in any design choice, precedence should be given to the implementation of a completely web-based client.;1
Wherever possible, the application should retain full usability with a keyboard input device only.;1
This allows an easy transition for employees who are primarily used to keyboard input in current ABC Paint business applications.;0
Finally, a utility should be available to report errors.;0
In all instances, the application should attempt full recovery and report errors automatically to ColorKast without encroaching on the user experience.;0
2.6 User Documentation Documentation for users will be made available in the form of on-line help within the client application itself.;0
An online tutorial will also be made available.;0
2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies ColorKast assumes that any use of the application will occur in an environment with full compliance to this specification.;0
The application will be dependant on third-party databases for storage of paint information and implementation of the color search engine.;1
The databases will give responses to Queries in sub- second time.;1
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 6 3.;0
External Interface Requirements 3.1 User Interfaces The application will have a task-based screen interface for increased usability and workflow pace.;0
The interface will use accelerator keys heavily to allow limited ?keyboard-only? application use.;0
A task-pane will be available in all workflow scenarios to allow easy access to on-line help and next-step options.;0
The navigation options in every screen will be similar to lower or eliminate the application learning curve.;0
Input confirmation and error notification will be consistent throughout the application.;0
A Pointing device will be required for color selection, for example, when matching colors or using the graphical color chooser.;0
3.2 Hardware Interfaces The application is dependent on existing hardware for a display device and for data-entry via a keyboard and Painting device.;0
The new system does not support legacy monochrome displays.;0
The application provides minimal support for client computers without a Painting device.;0
Display dependency: The client computer must have a display device capable of display of 16.7 million colors or greater.;0
Colors displayed on the target client computer will only be accurate when the device is properly calibrated.;0
Keyboard: The keyboard is used to enter and place Paint name and paint number searches.;0
The keyboard also provides ?keyboard-only? application functionality when a Painting device is not available.;0
Pointing device: The Pointing device provides intuitive, fluid control of the application for less sophisticated consumer users, and ease-of-use for the graphical color chooser interface.;1
3.3 Software Interfaces The ColorKast software will interface with other software for storage of paint information, paint collection data, and the matching and translation of paint color values.;0
Interface 1: Connection to database for storage of information for paint number, name, collection, and company.;1
Interface 2: Database connection for color search, matching, and paint number scheme translation.;1
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 7 These connections are implemented on the server.;0
The Web Browser must comply with standards for HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1.;0
HTTP version 1.0 is a well founded and highly supported protocol.;0
The product also indirectly requires some network connection to the internet, over which it may communicate in HTTP.;0
This network connection assumes a physical or wireless connection from the client computer to a consumer Internet Service Provider (ISP) or enterprise environment Local Area Network (LAN).;1
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 8 4.;0
System Features Each feature has a single mission it can complete independently.;0
This feature set is a modularized representation of the stand-alone application.;0
The modularization approach allows for a more robust application with fault tolerance and easy module replacement for security and upgradeability.;0
4.1 Graphical Color Chooser The graphical color chooser will be a pointing device driven intuitive color selection tool.;0
4.1.2 Functional Requirements The color chooser requires the presence of a hardware pointing device.;1
The color translator allows old scheme to new scheme paint number translation, given a paint number, collection and a target collection.;0
4.1.1 Priority High priority.;1
4.1.2 Functional Requirements The color translator requires the presence of the software color search module.;1
4.3 Closest Colors The closest color tool is a special case of the color search engine.;0
4.1.1 Priority High priority 4.1.2 Functional Requirements The closest colors tool requires the presence of the software color search module.;1
These two databases store paint and collection information.;0
4.5 User Color Palette This is a user experience tool.;0
The user color palette tool will store a list of the user?s recent color searches.;1
If the color sample matcher is loaded, the user color palette tool will also store recent uploaded images for matching.;1
The user color matcher only associates this information with a single client based on a persistent client session.;1
This user data will be removed from the server after 30 days.;1
This information is private but not secure.;1
4.6 Administrative Interface The administrative interface allows administrative users to update, add, and delete paint information.;0
Administrative users are also able to add users.;0
Refer to section 2.3 for development and implementation of user classes and access permissions.;0
4.1.1 Priority High priority 4.1.2 Functional Requirements The application administrative interface requires the color space and paint information databases to be present.;1
4.7 Color Sample Matcher The color sample matcher allows the client user to upload images in a common format for matching.;0
The color sample matcher will allow the user to graphically select with a hardware pointing device the color or blended color group they wish to use in a color search.;0
This module is not a requirement of the project.;0
It is included for specification purposes only.;0
4.1.2 Functional Requirements The color sample matcher requires the color search engine moolule to function.;0
The color chooser requires the presence of a hardware pornting devrce.;0
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 10 5.;0
Other Nonfunctional Requirements 5.1 Performance Requirements Color searches among the various collections defined by ABC Paint will be processed in sub- second time on the server.;0
Changes to Paint and collection information will occur in ReaI-time, although the actual processing time will vary with respect to the amount of information to be updated, added, or deleted on the server.;1
While performance requirements are transparently defined at the server, ColorKast makes no guarantees as to the speed, completeness, or timeliness of service over the greater internet.;0
Performance of the application will vary on the speed and type of internet access to which the client computer has access.;0
To verify the performance of the application, ColorKast will show the amount of time the server takes to process a request.;0
The time shown will not take into account the transit time of the information over various computer networks.;0
5.2 Safety Requirements Analysis of the proposed product requirements and features has not brought any safety concerns to light.;0
ColorKast recommends that a full legal review of the final product be undertaken prior to any public use of the product or business-wide rollout.;1
This will ensure that ABC Paint is allowed full indemnification of liability.;0
Refer to current state and federal regulations regarding workplace use of keyboard-based products.;0
Experts have concluded that the continued, repetitive use of data-entry and Painting devices leads to injury in almost all circumstances.;1
ColorKast takes no responsibility for injury or resulting damages from the use of these devices.;0
No attempts will be made to secure this information.;0
Information that the product will collect or store, which need access protections include user specified color palettes and their store of access permissions.;1
Most important, the store of access permissions to administrative features and access permissions must be secure.;0
Questions of application correctness come to lig ht with respect to the accurate display of color samples on the target client computer.;0
In the enterprise environment, we can assume that the kiosk or employee computer will have a correctly calibrated display device.;0
To allow calibration of the clientdisplay device is a possible extension of this application, but is not currently included in the specification.;0
ColorKast believes that a typical employee or consumer should be granted default privileges only.;0
A limited number of administrative users should be created to manage the paint data updates.;0
Administrative users can give other users administrative access up to their own access level only.;0
The software product being developed by ColorKast for ABC Paint.;0
A computer or program that can run applications or request application-based services from a server.;1
A group of colors made by the same company, designed by a specific designer, or provided in a separate group from other paints.;1
For example, the Ralph Lauren Collection.;0
A card, list, or other utility for displaying available or selected colors.;0
Logical color numbers used to represent physical colors normally represented as 363 triplets.;0
Hardware, a keyboard or mouse used to interact with an application.;0
An input device, such as a mouse, joystick, or trackball, with which one can move or manipulate a cursor or pointer to interact with an application.;1
Limited security through indirect verification of identity.;0
For example, in the ColorKast application, persistent user data is linked to a specific client session on a client computer, not a single individual.;0
A client?s request for information, generally as a formal request to a database or search engine.;0
This relates to computer systems that update information at the same rate as they receive data.;0
For example, if the time required to update information on the server is five minutes, then a ReaI-time update will take ?ve minutes.;0
A individual is linked directly to their persistent user data using a username and associated pass phrase.;0
This is required for all administrative level access.;0
A computer that processes requests for data and Queries that are elements of the application.;1
Processing for the client or server that occurs only on the server.;1
These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept of Operations (ConOps), in meetings with potential users and participants, and in subsequent documents identified below.;0
These requirements will form the basis for the design verification and validation of the system.;0
The intended audience for this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.;0
This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system.;0
In addition to increasing productivity, it will maximize their RWIS/ESS investments.;0
2) Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose weather forecasting for the protection of life and property.;0
3) Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations will support real-time operational responses to weather.;0
The Clarus Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a multitude of independent data collection systems.;0
Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best practices and the greater weather community.;0
The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.;0
? The first component is the development of the Clarus system ? a network for sharing, quality checking, and exchanging surface environmental data and relevant surface transportation conditions.;0
? The second component is the development of tools (such as decision support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system.;0
? ?Pavement data? in this context includes surface and subsurface data specified in NTCIP 1204 (Ref.;0
The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits to the protection of life and property.;0

2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.;0
This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context.;0
That context and the overall intent of the Clarus program are described in detail in the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref.;0
While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks.;0
"Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.";0
Each participating weather network?s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality.;0
Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus.;0
The primary recipients of this data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able to receive data if they so chose.;0
The data will be collected from the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be added.;0
When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus.;0
Figure 2 shows the general process as data progresses from collection through publication to service providers.;0
MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a standard interchange format.;1
While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.;0
While the participants may want to access the network through ?a one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations? (Ref.;0
12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system.;0
Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a ?one-stop? portal.;1
The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed.;1
This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus.;0
Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.;0
These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions.;0
The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between them?.;0
For example, a ?Collector? administers a ?Sensor,? collects ?Observation Data,? provides ?Sensor Metadata,? and receives ?Quality Feedback?.;0
The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.;0
Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.;0
These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref.;0
8) and summarized in Table 1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.;0
The design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the technical limitations of the system architecture.;0
Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and machine-based product generation.;1
The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers.;0
The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.;0
2.3 User Characteristics Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience.;0
Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.;1
The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.;1
This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative.;0
The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system.;0
From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref.;0
7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user?s interface or interaction with Clarus data.;0
The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.;1
The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.;1
The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data.;1
The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community.;1
The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data.;0
Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups.;0
The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus.;0
The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system.;0
The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems.;0
These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer ? the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system.;0
These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system.;0
The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.;0
Figure 6 ? Context Diagram of Clarus User Needs The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.;0
These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community.;1
This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions.;0
These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers.;0
Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.;0
? Transit ? These are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality- controlled data from it.;0
This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.;0
? Rail ? These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.;0
As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.;0
? Archives ? This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors.;0
The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.;0
2.4 General Constraints Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.;0
Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.;1
To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates.;1
An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue.;1
The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the system to expand and add new data sources and end-users.;0
Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system.;0
To maximize system uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of the system.;0
While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.;0
If the Clarus system fails, requestors will need to use their legacy systems.;0
The system will be ?open,? using architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry.;0
The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable.;0
Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards.;0
? Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No.;0
A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to ?critical national security missions.? Future applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.;0
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers.;0
While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources.;1
Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system.;0
Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data.;0
Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers.;0
Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.;1
Several requirements deal with ?regional? needs, without specifying regional boundaries.;0
It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems.;0
It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different (though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks.;0
Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries.;1
Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations.;1
The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.;1
Data in the system database and in published data sets will likely include geo- reference coordinates in decimal longitude, latitude, and elevation.;1
Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).;1
The base assumption regarding ?database tools? is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools.;1
No special database tools will be developed as a part of the Clarus system.;0
Some tools may developed in the future as part of ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.;0
The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this section.;0
Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and flow of information within the Clarus system.;0
A set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information.;0
The particular collector, QED, or EM service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the environmental data.;0
The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service.;0
It is a set of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus.;0
The specific algorithms and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules established through the configuration & administration service.;0
This arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.;0
There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and schedule services.;0
The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service disruption.;0
The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors.;1
The schedule service will also prioritize and respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure 7).;1
The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods.;0
Flagging out-of-range values is one example of a quality rule.;0
Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data.;0
This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process.;0
The QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality and can be continuously delivered.;1
The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users.;1
Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers.;0
Each of these components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a particular data format.;0
The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and program.;0
It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED retrieval schedules.;1
The configuration & administration service manages environ- mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage.;0
Data transactions and system operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user interface as well.;1
The configuration and administration user interface allows administrative users to interact with these functions and supports the manual quality review processes.;0
These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to specific components within the Clarus system.;0
The types of high-level requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces.;1
Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, development, and packaging of environmental data.;0
Figure 8 ? High-Level Requirements Context The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities.;0
The high-level requirements provide a basis for components in system elaboration, and detailed requirements are subsequently tied to specific components.;0
Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements.;0
The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high- level requirements.;0
In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3.;0
? Functional Requirements ? Lists the characteristics that the system must support for each interface.;1
Identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.;0
? Performance Requirements ? Specifies static and dynamic capacity for the number of users, connections, and other performance related factors.;1
? Organizational Requirements ? Includes requirements for policies and procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and institutional requirements to support the system.;1
Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the purpose or content of each column of the requirements table.;0
The matrix includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which have been deferred due to cost or complexity.;1
Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering system.;0
The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the classification and NNN is a unique number.;1
The detailed requirements are identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement and UU is a unique identifier.;1
This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support.;0
It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.;0
The functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific modules listed in Table 4.;0
Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement.;0
Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or component of the Clarus system.;1
Within each table, the high-level requirements show their allocations to particular modules.;1
If the high-level requirement is allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be repeated in the corresponding allocation?s module.;0
These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept of Operations (ConOps), in meetings with potential users and participants, and in subsequent documents identified below.;0
These requirements will form the basis for the design verification and validation of the system.;0
The intended audience for this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.;0
This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system.;0
Clarus is an initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S.;0
DOT) to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations.;0
In addition to increasing productivity, it will maximize their RWIS/ESS investments.;0
2) Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose weather forecasting for the protection of life and property.;0
3) Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations will support real-time operational responses to weather.;0
The Clarus Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a multitude of independent data collection systems.;0
Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best practices and the greater weather community.;0
Surface transportation environmental data collected by the Clarus system will include atmospheric data, pavement data?, and hydrologic (water level) data.;0
The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.;0
? The first component is the development of the Clarus system ? a network for sharing, quality checking, and exchanging surface environmental data and relevant surface transportation conditions.;0
? The second component is the development of tools (such as decision support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system.;0
? ?Pavement data? in this context includes surface and subsurface data specified in NTCIP 1204 (Ref.;0
The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits to the protection of life and property.;0
Data from the Clarus system will have a wide variety of direct and indirect uses.;0

2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.;0
This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context.;0
12), from which much of the description in this section was derived.;0
2.1 System Perspective The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a ?network of networks? ? much like the Internet ? for surface transportation environmental data.;0
While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks.;1
"Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.";1
Each participating weather network?s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality.;1
First, the participants will be able to share collected environmental data with Clarus.;1
Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus.;1
The data will be collected from the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be added.;1
When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus.;0
MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a standard interchange format.;1
While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.;0
While the participants may want to access the network through ?a one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations? (Ref.;0
12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system.;0
Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a ?one-stop? portal.;0
The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed.;0
This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus.;0
Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.;0
These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions.;0
The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between them?.;0
For example, a ?Collector? administers a ?Sensor,? collects ?Observation Data,? provides ?Sensor Metadata,? and receives ?Quality Feedback?.;0
The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.;0
Determining data types will be a significant challenge.;0
Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.;0
These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref.;0
8) and summarized in Table 1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.;0
There is also a period for which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements.;0
Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and machine-based product generation.;0
The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers.;0
The Clarus system design must address how best to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner.;0
The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.;0
? Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as it is transferred from the ESS to the end user.;0
Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.;0
The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.;0
This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative.;0
The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system.;0
From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref.;0
5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation (WIST) (Ref.;1
6), and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref.;1
7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user?s interface or interaction with Clarus data.;1
The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.;1
The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.;0
The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data.;0
The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community.;0
The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data.;0
Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups.;0
There is an inherent time scale, similar to Figure 4, emanating from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of data through the Clarus system and between the layers.;1
The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus.;0
The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system.;0
The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems.;0
These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer ? the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system.;0
These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system.;0
The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.;0
Figure 6 ? Context Diagram of Clarus User Needs The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.;0
These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community.;0
This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions.;0
These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers.;0
Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.;1
This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.;0
? Rail ? These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.;1
As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.;0
? Weather Service Providers ? These include the weather support services that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic components of the Clarus data.;1
? Archives ? This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors.;1
The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.;0
2.4 General Constraints Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.;0
Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.;0
To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates.;0
An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue.;0
Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment considerations.;0
Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system.;0
While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.;0
If the Clarus system fails, requestors will need to use their legacy systems.;0
The system will be ?open,? using architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry.;1
The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable.;1
Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards.;0
? Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No.;1
A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to ?critical national security missions.? Future applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.;0
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers.;0
While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources.;0
Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system.;0
Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data.;0
Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers.;0
Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.;0
Accepting data from contributors who cannot provide these tags with the data could seriously complicate the design of the data acquisition interfaces.;0
Several requirements deal with ?regional? needs, without specifying regional boundaries.;0
It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems.;1
It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different (though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks.;1
Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries.;1
Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations.;0
The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.;0
Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).;0
The base assumption regarding ?database tools? is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools.;1
Some tools may developed in the future as part of ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.;0
The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this section.;0
Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and flow of information within the Clarus system.;0
The collector, QED, and EM services are sets of services because each individual service represents a particular data format interface.;0
A set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information.;0
The particular collector, QED, or EM service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the environmental data.;0
The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service.;0
It is a set of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus.;0
The specific algorithms and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules established through the configuration & administration service.;0
This arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.;0
There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and schedule services.;0
The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service disruption.;0
The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors.;1
The schedule service will also prioritize and respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure 7).;1
The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods.;1
Flagging out-of-range values is one example of a quality rule.;0
Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data.;0
This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process.;0
The QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality and can be continuously delivered.;1
The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users.;1
Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers.;0
Each of these components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a particular data format.;0
The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and program.;0
It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED retrieval schedules.;0
The configuration & administration service manages environ- mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage.;0
Data transactions and system operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user interface as well.;0
These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to specific components within the Clarus system.;0
The high-level requirements in this document are limited to those that can be derived from a context diagram (Figure 8) that pictures the Clarus system as a single functional block with its interfaces.;0
The types of high-level requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces.;0
Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, development, and packaging of environmental data.;0
Figure 8 ? High-Level Requirements Context The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities.;0
Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements.;0
The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high- level requirements.;0
In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3.;0
? Functional Requirements ? Lists the characteristics that the system must support for each interface.;0
Identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.;0
? Organizational Requirements ? Includes requirements for policies and procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and institutional requirements to support the system.;0
Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the purpose or content of each column of the requirements table.;0
The matrix includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which have been deferred due to cost or complexity.;1
Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering system.;0
The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the classification and NNN is a unique number.;1
The detailed requirements are identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement and UU is a unique identifier.;1
This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support.;0
It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.;0
The functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific modules listed in Table 4.;0
Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement.;0
Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or component of the Clarus system.;0
Within each table, the high-level requirements show their allocations to particular modules.;0
If the high-level requirement is allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be repeated in the corresponding allocation?s module.;0
Following the high-level requirement, detailed requirement(s) are shown to create more refined requirements specific to the associated module.;0
