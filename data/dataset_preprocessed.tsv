14	0	a	2 in order to create the vcd an implemented it system will have to collect certificates and attestations from existing registries 
15	0	a	therefore the contracting authority must either specify the documentation that has to be submitted by economic operator or the criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion that have to be fulfilled by the economic operator 
16	0	a	work package 2 will not implement a common set of attestations

29	0	a	 national criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion should have the right granularity and should be consistent among themselves 
30	0	a	the members of this work package must perform the mapping between national attestations and european criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion

116	0	a	the purpose of iso iec 11179 is to give concrete guidance on the formulation and maintenance of discrete data element descriptions and semantic content metadata that shall be used to formulate data elements in a consistent standardized manner 
117	0	a	the pre vcd mapping tool therefore will provide sufficient support and has to be integrated into a vcd system 
118	0	a	description a vcd package will show its full potential only when all requested evidences all that are necessary to prove all the requested criteria are contained within it 
119	0	a	those interfaces should also provide the possibility to describe structural data context specific data and where applicable validation values of the evidence along with common semantics 
120	0	a	the stages are logically built upon each other but it must be possible to implement certain features of stage 4 if the necessary requirements for this are fulfilled in the lower stages even if maybe not all requirements are fulfilled in stage 3 
121	0	a	the validation value should be able to prove conformance to criteria of qualitative exclusion and selection unambiguously 
122	0	a	as it is quite complex to establish a common and unique classification scheme cross border and cross sector business document instances should be carry metadata about classification schemes they use

133	0	a	in particular a european service provider refers to the pre vcd mapping tool which will provide a basis for all other vcd application in the subsequent stages 
134	0	a	3 4 1 overview of technical framework this chapter shall include technical requirements that are essential for submitting a vcd via the peppol infrastructures 
135	0	a	peppol will need to design an authentication system that serves its purposes 
136	0	a	in order to obtain trust the vcd services should use certified time stamps 
137	0	a	overall we see a need for commonly monitored identity and access management in particular for all national vcd solutions and for the peppol infrastructure thus both approaches should be aligned and should make use of the same mechanisms through for example single sign on functionality 
138	0	a	apart from functionalities like addressability and discovery the infrastructure should provide access points to support the actors or services to connect to the infrastructure 
139	0	a	the peppol infrastructure will make it possible to exchange electronic business documents in a secure and reliable manner 
140	0	a	3 4 2 3 allocation of identifiers description work package 2 will use the peppol infrastructure for discovering addressing information which is typically stored in a registry 
141	0	a	a method must be found how to allocate identifiers to the participants that use the infrastructure for transportation of vcds and related services 
142	0	a	requirement every party participating should have a secure and verifiable electronic address 
143	0	a	it must be possible to discover the verified electronic address for an identified party 
144	0	a	3 4 2 7 access points to the peppol infrastructure the peppol infrastructure will make it possible to exchange electronic business documents in a secure and reliable manner 
145	0	a	for wp2 it will important to access the infrastructure from different perspectives 
146	0	a	the peppol infrastructure must have the capability to submit a vcd to a contracting authority or tendering platform
147	0	a	the peppol infrastructure should have the capability to submit a bid which contains a vcd 
148	0	a	specifically contracting authorities must provide a way to receive electronic tenders and ensure those electronic tenders are not accessed until the prescribed time for opening them 
149	0	a	it must be possible to guarantee confidentiality for specific documents 
150	0	a	the e tendering platform must offer download functionality for forms and other material to be filled in signed and returned by an economic operator 
151	0	a	despite legal issues about the integrity of certain documents such as the electronic invoices it should be a general rule to assure the integrity of all documents exchanged between partners 
152	0	a	requirement time stamping should be applied in some processes to certify relevant date and time 
153	0	a	requirement the electronic procurement process must have an audit trailing to ensure transparency for both parties 
154	0	a	this will also enable vcds of the piloting country to work on a wider scope 
155	0	a	with a total of eight pilot implementations plus the european service provider implementation of the pre vcd mapping tool the wp 2 will reach a wide geographical spread as well as a profound proof of the overall vcd concept 
156	0	a	hence individual member state countries will already have such infrastructures and access mechanisms in place or will have to implement them within national scope 
157	0	a	4 3 austrian implementation and piloting proposal 4 3 1 implementation approach austria will implement and pilot a vcd service based on the vcd concept introduced in this report 
158	0	a	the austrian vcd system will give a living proof of concept of complex pan european constellations where interoperability is a key success factor for the whole vcd concept 
159	0	a	this way the austrian vcd implementation will ensure full pan european interoperability and will lead to a dynamic situation regarding the legal rule set and its flexibility to adapt to legal and organisational changes 
160	0	a	in a subsequent step issuing services should be sequentially adapted to support automated data retrieval 
161	0	a	this adaption will take place after the peppol project 
162	0	a	the piloting phase of the austrian vcd implementation will include several selected stakeholders which take up key positions in the austrian procurement landscape 
163	0	a	this interfacing activity will precede the final design and the real pilot implementation 
164	0	a	the vcd should encompass this change 
165	0	a	the vcd will provide the possibility to utilize evidences used in one member state and to submit them across borders to any european contracting authority 
166	0	a	economic operators will be enabled to perform checks with regard to the existence and validity of the requested evidences in the vcd package 
167	0	a	the development of context specific data shall ensure the automatic processing of electronic attestations without regard to linguistic barriers 
168	0	a	the development of standards and context specific vocabularies is time consuming and requires long term involvement of user groups that will make use of these standards 
169	0	a	since cen bii workshop is close to an end it will probably not work out to do this development within its scope 
170	0	a	nevertheless we will start to develop common representations context specific data for evidences that have an easy structure low quantity of contents and marginal variances in their contents 
171	0	a	the vcd will not enforce any development of electronic attestation on a national level as this is a clear national duty and is depended upon the development of context specific data 
172	0	a	furthermore the possibility to re use evidences that are still valid time and the maintenance of a vcd will again provide possibilities for cost reductions at the side of the economic operator 
173	0	a	at least the structural representation of attestation will provide benefit for the entities involved by providing transparency about the tendering requirements and the evidences that have to be submitted in cross border procedures 
174	0	a	the pre vcd mapping tool in particular will ensure transparency on cross border tendering requirements and will give indications about mutual recognition of evidences across borders 
175	0	a	in this respect the vcd should support current practices in exchanging evidence in the short run and lead towards smooth reliable and sustainable exchange of electronic evidence among member states in the long run 
176	0	a	the requirements will be the basis for further development and will provide guidance and reference to subsequent activities 
177	0	a	the two pilots scheduled within wp 2 will concentrate their efforts on these latter stages and hence will evidence the potentials of these stages

3045	0	a	any distributed product release from the infrastructure implementor will necessarily include both the software side and the hardware side components of the sce mi 
3046	0	a	the macros are parametrized such that at the point of instantiation crucial parameters that will dictate the dimensions of the sce mi bridge to software can be easily specified by the user 
3047	0	a	these two macros are mutually associated by the clocknum parameter and every scemiclockport macro must have a minimum of one scemiclockcontrol macro associated with it 
3048	0	a	the transactor must be designed to take any arriving data immediately as it is not guaranteed to be held for subsequent uclock cycles 
3049	0	a	an important point to note is that it is totally up to the application to follow the protocol that if the transactor is not ready to receive input the software model should not do a send 
3050	0	a	a well behaved software model should know not to do a send if it has not received an input ready callback assuming the input ready propagation mechanism is being deployed 
3051	0	a	so the idea is that when the transactor wants to say i m ready for input it will assert the receiveready input to the scemimessageinport which will cause an input ready callback to be called on the software side the next time serviceloop is entered

3054	0	a	transactors that do not care about controlling negedges such as the one shown in figure 5 on page 17 should tie this signal high 
3055	0	a	a well crafted infrastructure linker however should maximize ease of use by transparently providing the end user with a suitable set of default values for implementation specific parameters so that most if not all of these parameters need not be overridden 
3056	0	a	it shall be assumed that any module that is to be officially considered a transactor must have at least one scemiclockcontrol instance immediately inside it 
3057	0	a	for certain implementations it might be useful as a hint to the infrastructure linker to decide which output ports should be serviced first should they happen to present message data on the same uclock and are implemented over a number of physical message channels 
3058	0	a	this access block must support access to a specifically named set of parameters required by the sce mi as well as an optional implementation specified set of named parameters 
3059	0	a	4 3 software side interface c api to gain access to the hardware side of the sce mi the software side must first initialize the sce mi software side infrastructure and then bind to port proxies representing each message port defined on the hardware side 
3060	0	a	any calls that support returning a recoverable error status should return that status using a separate dedicated return argument 
3061	0	a	all parameters whether specified by the user or not must have default values

4809	1	a	hence a major objective of the european commission is to enable european wide eprocurement across borders by creating common principles and technical solutions that are applied within all member states 
4810	1	a	eprocurement requires efforts to be done by public administrations in particular to exploit new technologies for interoperability that enable easy information accessibility improving the availability of pan european services and interaction among citizens and businesses european_dynamics_s_a 2004 
4811	1	a	a european wide eprocurement infrastructure could save governments up to 5 on expenditure and the transaction costs for both buyers and suppliers could be reduced by 50 80 
4812	1	a	a greater competition and efficiency in eprocurement will influence the whole economy and may also play an important role in achieving the lisbon objectives e g to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world commission_of_the_european_communitites 2004 
4813	1	a	however current eprocurement infrastructures are inappropriate to reach this ambitious aim since these are characterized by a high market fragmentation 
4814	1	a	systems are either centrally oriented or designed to reflect federated systems demands 
4815	1	a	to facilitate eu wide interoperability in public eprocurement the european commission co funds the peppol project in the ict policy support programme within the competiveness and innovation 
4816	1	a	the economic operators have to submit evidence and proof in respect of these criteria 
4817	1	a	it also enables the economic operator to add self declarations or other documents of formal qualification 
4818	1	a	furthermore the vcd solution supports economic operators in producing a vcd and in enabling them to submit the required documentation assembled as an information package to any contracting authority in europe 
4819	1	a	4 in the same way the vcd as an implemented it system will enable contracting authorities or their etendering systems to interpret and accept the documentation submitted by the economic operator 
4820	1	a	a major challenge of peppols work package 2 is to integrate various stakeholders in the development process and to set up an it system which supports a common set of evidences based on electronic business certificates and qualification documents that are most frequently required 
4821	1	a	 article 46 suitability to pursue a professional activity e g certificate of registration from the commercial register 1 www peppol eu p e n d i n g e c a p p r o 
4822	1	a	a key aspect in the vcd development is to support a common set of criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion derived from the directive and their fulfilment through evidences 
4823	1	a	in such cases economic operators can only provide similar evidences that fulfil the same criteria 
4824	1	a	public tenders below that threshold can use other channels for the contract notice depending on national legislation e g contract notices may be mandatory in national official gazettes 
4825	1	a	an economic operator can use means such as the ted system existing tendering platforms or official national gazettes to search for contract notices 2 and to retrieve the relevant information about active tenders 3 
4826	1	a	the mandatory publication of contract notices in ted is a means to ensure transparency for public procurement throughout europe and to enable a well functioning inner market 
4827	1	a	for contract notices below threshold ted can also complement existing national sources through widespread information across borders 
4828	1	a	this means that the economic operator has to match these criteria set out in the contract notice of another country with the evidences attestations statements and certificates of his or her own country in order to prove compliance 4 
4829	1	a	the step of retrieving proofs of suitability and non exclusion and collecting documents for the receiving entities becomes a necessary task and may take place at different times 
4830	1	a	 a statement issued by the economic operator is adopted to claim an initial suitability for applying and attending a tender 
4831	1	a	in this case economic operators may retrieve their proofs of suitability only at a later stage if necessary at all 
4832	1	a	in this case accredited official translators lawyers or notaries have to issue such legally attested translations of evidences 
4833	1	a	to give a flavour of diverging procedures in regards to document handling 6 in wp 2 partner countries european member states such as france and germany accept legally binding self declarations 
4834	1	a	the current status is that each economic operator has to perform the full delivery of documents 
4835	1	a	each economic operator usually has to submit a full set of documents proving his suitability 
4836	1	a	currently a new version of the austrian federal procurement act is elaborated which will probably change the necessity for the economic operator to just give a declaration on oath concerning the economic operator s suitability 
4837	1	a	countries such as norway may follow yet another approach by requesting a set of formal documents i e those regulated by law to be submitted by the economic operator at the time of the tender 
4838	1	a	in order to reach these goals we propose an approach with different stages of maturity that may be applied dependent on the readiness for the individual member state 
4839	1	a	the aim is to support basic interoperability and exchange of documents on the lower maturity levels and leading towards direct electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity levels 
4840	1	a	a staged implementation approach is necessary in order to handle the complexity of the domain and to take into account the needs of the member states 
4841	1	a	the efforts and expenses to develop a solution that ensures basic interoperability ought to be manageable and affordable 
4842	1	a	figure 2 illustrates the staged maturity model of the vcd that has been designed to show the different stages of implementation and development 
4843	1	a	it is therefore necessary to ensure national transparency by gathering national requirements on certificates and qualification documents 
4844	1	a	stage 3 includes one of the most critical parts of a vcd which consist of making the evidences contained in a vcd comparable with regard to their contents to enable automated processing and understanding of its contents across borders stage 3 vcd advanced package 
4845	1	a	instead a contracting authority can request those documents on demand from a database pull at national service provider who hosts vcd services or directly from the very registration authority 
4846	1	a	the model as presented in figure 2 is further described in the following subsection with the purpose to detail the various stages 
4847	1	a	 one criterion may require one or more attestations in order to be proved documents may be machine readable digital copies unstructured contents or machine interpretable structured content thus can be processed by machines 
4848	1	a	an attestation is made up of one or more document s including machine interpretable data that describes these attestation e g issuing date vcd can provide direct access to attestation if there is a mandatory rule for it in law 
4849	1	a	 vcd systems provide single point of contact to attestations from public sources and information necessary to prove conformance to a given call for tender 
4850	1	a	a vcd package may contain self declarations and several other documents provided by the economic operator 
4851	1	a	on the peppol wp2 strategy there is explicit interest to have parallel increments on both sides assuming that the semantic enrichment of the vcd package requires a corresponding enriched supporting system 
4852	1	a	there are no vcd services established which compile validate or deliver vcd packages 
4853	1	a	on this level of support all necessary information structural data of evidence and context specific data of the included evidences are provided and the contracting authority is able to make a decision about the suitability of the economic operator 
4854	1	a	the range of evidences varies from self declarations to official attestations or certificates issued by public authorities see figure 7 for a categorization 
4855	1	a	from a pragmatic point of view it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of evidences in a first step and to complete the vcd package later on 
4856	1	a	it is also reasonable to define a default package list that has to be provided in most public tenders by economic operators independently of particular criteria mentioned by the call for tender 
4857	1	a	names contents and qualities of vcd vary between countries and in many cases economic operators are using the options of article 51 to add additional up to date information from public registries 
4858	1	a	it is a precondition to guarantee cross border interoperability 
4859	1	a	beyond the third step every ms may decide which path to follow and which level to achieve 
4860	1	a	the path of development provides an idea of how to structure the national vcd project 
4861	1	a	a ms may next decide to stay there no move or to complete his service 
4862	1	a	 move to the right or to keep the narrow focus and head for the highest level of support move upwards cf figure 2 
4863	1	a	the pre vcd mapping tool introduces a procedure to collect information about the evidences for specific call for tenders 
4864	1	a	thereby the status quo procedure of section 1 2 remains unchanged except that a pre vcd mapping exists which is implemented and provided through a european service provider8 see figure 5 
4865	1	a	likewise the contracting authority can check evidences and authorizations provided by economic operators via the pre vcd mapping tool step 9 
4866	1	a	figure 5 stage 1 pre vcd mapping with pre vcd mapping tool to fulfill a first precondition for a vcd package as introduced in stages 2 and beyond the pre vcd mapping tool is the proposed function and the process that allows for its execution 
4867	1	a	for every domain we suppose to get a representation of a national index which provides an overview of national criteria demanded in public procurement and how these are evidenced i e which attestations and or statements provide what evidence 
4868	1	a	with this taxonomy it is possible to map the fact that evidences can either be provided by the candidate himself e g self declaration declaration on oath solemn statement or specific issuers as certified authorities and or authorized third parties 
4869	1	a	a provision of alternative means for evidencing criteria when foreign economic operators are considered a tool to facilitate identification of evidences needed across countries and the respective up to date mappings 
4870	1	a	an economic operator participating in a tender of a foreign country can quite easily understand the requirements what criteria have to be fulfilled and decide which are the best national attestations self declarations included to prove the criteria requested by the contracting authority 
4871	1	a	the contracting authority can activate a direct access to attestations that are exposed through open services including the international cross linking 
4872	1	a	 2004 18 ec_art 47 50 the economic operator does n t have to type in the relevant criteria or evidences to retrieve the mapping because the contracting authority uses a formal specification in an electronic format to define the relevant selection or exclusion criteria 
4873	1	a	specification and application of new procedure to provide the criteria in a formally specified format 
4874	1	a	if an economic operator decides to participate in a particular call for tender he can directly retrieve relevant information about evidences and criteria by using the information published in the call for tender 
4875	1	a	in cases below threshold or in the cases where the public notice is partial the economic operator might send a direct request to the contracting authority in order to retrieve the required information 
4876	1	a	figure 9 main actors and functions to be implemented to provide the relevant information and conditions to run a pre vcd mapping tool 2 2 3 major features requirements and quality attributes major feature pre vcd mapping tool 
4877	1	a	the right granularity and consistency of criteria will be important to ensure legitimacy and to retrieve adequate mapping results 
4878	1	a	2 2 3 4 define a mapping template perform mapping and ensure legitimacy in a first step all member states do have to establish a mapping of the criteria defined in the relevant eu directive 2004 18 ec to the national attestations giving evidence to these criteria 
4879	1	a	for the overall activity it will be important to have the appropriate legal support in order to ensure legitimacy of mappings 
4880	1	a	2 2 3 5 ensure legitimacy and trust of mapping in order to achieve trust and an agreement on the mutual recognition of qualification documents as demanded in the directive all artefacts and mapping results that relate to the mapping of evidence have to be approved from a legal point of view 
4881	1	a	contracting authorities approaching the tool have to assess the compatibility of the mapping template with their inspection procedures and code of practice 
4882	1	a	the european commission as well as the national bodies have to update the mapping model in case the legal grounds change or the mapping of european criteria to national evidences and issuing bodies change 
4883	1	a	 adoption and approval procedures have to be defined and enacted in order to install the pre vcd mapping and pre vcd mapping tool as an official mapping model 
4884	1	a	 precondition the adoption of the model requires a parallel effort from the legal side to compare whether the provisions of existing nppas can get a harmonization through the referencing to the eu directive 
4885	1	a	this is a major requirement to drive the action of contracting authorities that have strict obligations to follow while performing in a tendering procedure 
4886	1	a	the mapping facility independent of how such as system is actually implemented has to provide the services with regard to the pre vcd mapping tool centralized or decentralized infrastructure 
4887	1	a	in the latter case one could define that each national system only hosts the national mapping or that each one hosts all the different national mappings which would make a synchronization of the different systems necessary 
4888	1	a	the technical means to provide the mapping service has to be defined in dependence on the choice of the pilot solution 
4889	1	a	also the higher maturity levels defined in this vision stage 2 4 can use the mapping service in order to retrieve the mapping information 
4890	1	a	a governing model has to be defined in order to deploy the infrastructure to maintain its state and sustainability over time 
4891	1	a	the liability of the organisation that governs infrastructure and mapping facility has to be defined in order to ensure trust into the system and particular mapping results 
4892	1	a	sustainability sustainability is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state into the future 
4893	1	a	2 2 3 11 define the interaction among publication body and contracting authority in order to derive sufficient mapping information the economic operator has to provide the criteria that are relevant to a particular call for tender 
4894	1	a	 a powerful search mechanism is implemented to deliver good results when economic operators query the pre vcd mapping tool in order to understand what evidences he can deliver to confer to the selection and exclusion criteria set in a public tender in another member state 
4895	1	a	the member states need to update the mapping in case of any change within a short time frame e g five days after a legal change has been put into force 
4896	1	a	the contracting authority can as well use the mapping in order to check if the attestations handed in by an economic operator of another country are sufficiently evidencing those selection and exclusion criteria defined for the tender 
4897	1	a	the contracting authority and economic operator can only retrieve information about the issuing bodies of particular evidences when a member state has specified accredited public issuing bodies and recognized private issuing bodies within the national part of the pre vcd mapping 
4898	1	a	stage 2 requires the establishment of a national vcd service provider which hosts the vcd system in order to provide economic operators with the services necessary to create an early vcd package 
4899	1	a	the vcd system wants to ensure completeness of a vcd package by acting as a single point of contact for the economic operator that supports him in creating a vcd package from various sources 
4900	1	a	thereby translation of evidences may be still necessary and has to be performed by the economic operator in dependence on national legal and organizational requirements because the vcd package does not provide any standardised context specific data which provide common semantics 
4901	1	a	the types of data listed above have to be defined and agreed by the members of this work package in order to create a common structure of a vcd package 
4902	1	a	furthermore the vcd package needs to provide the ability to be human readable thus a vcd viewing system is introduced in this stage too 
4903	1	a	in order to enable the economic operator to send the vcd simple package to any contracting authority stage 2 introduces the vcd transportation system which is strongly connected to the peppol infrastructure proposed by wp8 
4904	1	a	each ms vcd creating service establish a service that is capable of compiling vcd packages 
4905	1	a	the overall pre condition to access the vcd system is that the economic operator has previously been authenticated so that the vcd system can check appropriate user rights within identity and access management 
4906	1	a	most member states require that evidences are provided in the target language thus a translator may have to translate evidences within the external vcd translation 
4907	1	a	the vcd transportation system is used to submit the vcd to the contracting authorities 
4908	1	a	contracting authorities can then authenticate and use the vcd viewing system to access and view the vcd package 
4909	1	a	identity and access management economic operators have to apply for a vcd account and therefore they have to provide sensitive economic operator data for example by uploading attestations to verify these data 
4910	1	a	in order to create an account and to start any vcd packaging service 
4911	1	a	an officer has to verify whether the provided data belongs to the economic operator and has to assure its correctness because either the vcd packaging service would not work or would deliver incomplete or wrong results 
4912	1	a	in addition identity and access management requires the possibility to delete an account within the vcd system and an official procedure to apply for a modification of the vcd account 
4913	1	a	an economic operator can authenticate to the vcd system only when the economic operator has sufficient user rights e g authorized representative of economic operator provided by identity and access management as shown in figure 12 
4914	1	a	version 1 0 pending ec approval figure 12 interrelation between identity and access management and vcd system 2 3 2 2 vcd system after authentication the economic operator can provide further tender specific data to the vcd system 
4915	1	a	e g ted i d in order to start the creation of a vcd simple package 
4916	1	a	the vcd system creates a suggestion for compilation according to the results provided by the pre vcd mapping tool and in turn the economic operator can edit and confirm the compilation suggestion that is given by the vcd system as shown in figure 13 
4917	1	a	evidence and structural evidence data is provided by issuing bodies which can submit evidence and structural evidence data to the vcd system via an interface 
4918	1	a	an important remark therefore is that economic operators can take the role of an issuing body by submitting for example candidate statements manually collected evidence or translations of evidence 
4919	1	a	the interface to submit evidence is defined through a service definition that allows adding specific structural evidence data that belongs to that evidence 
4920	1	a	the vcd system can now compile the vcd package and creates a set of structural vcd package data that belong to the compilation process 
4921	1	a	2 3 2 3 vcd transportation system the economic operator can submit the vcd simple package to the contraction authority by using the vcd transportation system which is part of the peppol infrastructure 
4922	1	a	for using the vcd transportation system of wp8 both economic operators and contracting authorities have to authenticate to have access 
4923	1	a	the economic operator receives a vcd package by the vcd system and it is up to his choice how to submit the vcd package to the contracting authority 
4924	1	a	2 3 2 4 vcd viewing system after retrieving the vcd package from economic operators contracting authorities may have to authenticate to the vcd viewing system in order to view the vcd package 
4925	1	a	vcd viewing system the vcd viewing system has to fulfil certain sub functionalities for displaying the different kinds of data that are contained within a vcd package 
4926	1	a	to start the vcd packaging service 
4927	1	a	economic operator data is the information needed to start the process and the economic operator thereby has to assure the correctness of its data because either the packaging service would not work or would deliver incomplete results 
4928	1	a	there needs to be a specific registration procedure where an economic operator provides economic operator data to the vcd service provider in order to create an account 
4929	1	a	the vcd service provider then creates an account for the economic operator where sufficient economic operator data is stored in order to retrieve attestations 
4930	1	a	an official procedure has to be defined to change this economic operator data to ensure updated economic operator data 
4931	1	a	describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces that are needed to manage a vcd account 
4932	1	a	an officer has to create a vcd account for the economic operator 
4933	1	a	initialization of vcd request this feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces that are needed to request a vcd instance that is addressing a particular call for tender 
4934	1	a	describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces that are needed to arrange a vcd instance according to the needs of an economic operator 
4935	1	a	this feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces that are needed to collect evidence from various sources 
4936	1	a	this feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces to compile a vcd instance out of different data formats from various sources 
4937	1	a	this feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces to exchange vcd packages between the economic operator and the contracting authority 
4938	1	a	this feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces to view the data contained in the vcd package 
4939	1	a	the major aim of stage 2 is to draft logical systems that enable economic operators to create simple vcd packages and to submit them to contracting authorities 
4940	1	a	stage 2 also introduces the idea of a national vcd service provider which operates the different services necessary to create and view a vcd package 
4941	1	a	in those cases the vcd system will provide the possibility to add those documents into the vcd simple package through placeholders which may have a very generic grounding for mapping defined through an abstract class of documents e g evidence with regards to environmental management standards 
4942	1	a	however a reduced scope of a vcd is necessary in order to provide the possibility to submit a vcd that has a sufficient level of completeness 
4943	1	a	the usage of context specific data thereby is an important pre condition since these data can provide real time information about the status of contents of the vcd which is needed in terms of making update proposals 
4944	1	a	in most cases the contracting authority does not have to view the delivered evidence in every detail to come to a decision 
4945	1	a	but at the same stage the vcd service could offer additional support decision support by embedding context specific data that means a vcd package could contain the digital copy of evidences possibly in various formats and structural data of evidences as in stage 2 augmented by context specific data 
4946	1	a	possibility to replace the full document translation with a selective translation of context specific data keywords and major contents 
4947	1	a	the selective translation can arrange multiple languages in particular when context specific data belongs to a common agreed dictionary of expressions 
4948	1	a	the vcd creation services are able to receive context specific data from issuing services and process this data into the vcd package 
4949	1	a	possibility for the national vcd service provider to take the role of a trusted third party which approves the evidence formally 
4950	1	a	use case diagram for vcd advanced package re compilation 2 4 2 1 create vcd advanced package 
4951	1	a	this use case contains the necessary steps an economic operator performs to create a new vcd advanced package 
4952	1	a	this use case is similar to the use case create vcd simple package of stage 2 but adds the necessary functionality regarding context specific data and merging existing vcd packages into the new vcd advanced package 
4953	1	a	this overview the data representation can be implemented either language independent or in multiple languages so there is no need to translate the evidence any more if it is sufficiently described through context specific data 
4954	1	a	quality attributes context specific data 
4955	1	a	2 4 3 2 advanced vcd creation service the vcd creation service of stage 2 vcd simple package has to be improved in order to include the functionalities for considering context specific data and vcd merging 
4956	1	a	 check the correctness suitability of content quickly with the possibility to react when necessary 
4957	1	a	 technical possibility for automated decision support which enables the analysis of relevant context specific data out of the evidences without the need to view those reduced time and cost for validating the suitability of an economic operator 
4958	1	a	providing context specific data leads to an additional support for the economic operator and for the contracting authority addressing the need to evaluate the contents of evidences across borders 
4959	1	a	an economic operator is able to verify the correctness of the provided context specific data 
4960	1	a	the contracting authority in turn can check the suitability of an economic operator by having a sufficient summary of the contents of a vcd in the required language 
4961	1	a	this approach follows again the idea to ensure the completeness of the vcd on the one hand and the level of support on the other hand by stepwise including more electronic evidences to the vcd 
4962	1	a	one reasonable way to achieve this goal is to put this work on the agenda of context specific networks e g brite ecris and standardisation organisations e g cen 
4963	1	a	nevertheless wp2 would like approve whether it is possible to use simplified representations of evidences expressed as context specific data to provide a unified representation of major contents 
4964	1	a	if a specific criminal record for example does not have any entry inside it can be represented in context specific format by having a code list saying nothing or no entry 
4965	1	a	another example could be for example a balance sheet which can have several different values but an easy representation could only be expressed through definition of certain ranges e g below 1 million from 1 million to 10 etc 
4966	1	a	in any case the usage of context specific data can not prevent and exclude specific needs from contracting authorities that may require concurrence of both the original evidence including certified translation and context specific data 
4967	1	a	the key idea of stage 4 is to create a network for the vcd that allows retrieving attestations in a more flexible way 
4968	1	a	the virtual company dossier than consists of some references to attestation services which mandate a contracting authority to obtain information directly 
4969	1	a	a direct exchange between trusted attestation services and a contracting authority would provide many opportunities with regard to an increase of the actuality of evidence to lower the transaction costs of the parties involved and to reduce the time to create a vcd 
4970	1	a	also from a political point of view there might be several objections to give a direct access to source registers and issuing bodies 
4971	1	a	in order to avoid some of the above mentioned complexity we propose some first steps that might help to combine the ideas of a vcd and a federated network in medium term allowing further improvements of a vcd 
4972	1	a	we suggest that a national vcd service provider uses a temporary storage to hold the attestations instead of compiling them directly into a vcd 
4973	1	a	the vcd then only consists of a number of flags that denote an evidence as well as structural data of evidence and context specific data plus a reference to retrieve the attestation on demand at the time of awarding 
4974	1	a	also mechanism for maintenance of evidence could potentially be implemented in order to keep the information up to date 
4975	1	a	such model of indirect exchange would also make it easier for a national vcd service to establish an official list of approved economic operators in accordance with article 52 1 of directive 2004 18 ec 
4976	1	a	the national vcd service provider could use the information within its storage to maintain such lists 
4977	1	a	stage 4 therewith improves the level of support for the economic operator since the need and burden to present specific attestations to the contracting authority will be eliminated 
4978	1	a	we propose the following major building blocks to establish a vcd networked package compilation of evidence within a vcd is based on structural and context specific data 
4979	1	a	the compiled vcd network package only contains both data types and provides references to retrieve attestations when necessary i e on demand 
4980	1	a	the vcd contains references in the meaning of processing instructions for the contracting authority to retrieve the requested attestations on individual basis at the time of awarding 
4981	1	a	the reference or processing instruction includes a mechanism to grant access rights to the contracting authority in order to retrieve these attestations within a certain period of time 
4982	1	a	mechanisms for maintenance of evidence could potentially be implemented in order to keep the information up to date and respectively maintain a state of accredited economic operators 
4983	1	a	the vcd network package will include all the data that is necessary to qualify an economic operator according to the methods rules and functions described in stages 2 3 
4984	1	a	the only difference is that some of these evidences are not directly included into the vcd but can be retrieved through references in order to allow the contracting authority to retrieve the evidence on individual basis or on demand 
4985	1	a	stage 4 allows further implementations towards federated networks and provides opportunities to establish lists of approved economic operators in accordance with article 52 1 of directive 2004 18 ec10 
4986	1	a	non repudiation and data integrity standardization and agreement on well working context specific data mechanisms to identify economic operators national vcd service providers and contracting authorities in order to indentify authenticate them and to grant access to retrieve attestations 
4987	1	a	interfaces protocols and temporary storage to obtain on demand vcd network packages opportunity for a national vcd service to establish an official list of approved economic operators in accordance with article 52 1 of directive 2004 18 ec 
4988	1	a	vcd is compiled in the same way as in stages 2 3 but contains validation values derived from context specific data which are approved by the national vcd service provider vcd service provider can maintain a list of approved economic operators 
4989	1	a	the national service provider starts the vcd creation process by requesting attestations from trusted attestation services that are connected to context specific networks 
4990	1	a	the contracting authority can now request attestations through the reference that is specified in the vcd request attestation on individual basis 
4991	1	a	the vcd system checks whether the contracting authority has sufficient access rights and has been mandated by the economic operator to retrieve that attestation check access rights 
4992	1	a	the economic operator than may have to provide an additional translation to the contracting authority within a certain period of time 
4993	1	a	this may include creating contracting authority specific or vcd specific references in order to identify a mandate that has been given by the economic operator to this contracting authority for retrieving attestation or even updates on it 
4994	1	a	enables economic operator to provide selective access to his data and to avoid misuse of it 
4995	1	a	 conflict resolution ensures that errors can be handled and solved manually between the parties involved implementation of article 52 stage 4 provides a good opportunity to implement article 52 of directive 2004 18 ec reduction of burden for economic operators 
4996	1	a	 possibility for the economic operator to maintain a state of permanent qualification 
4997	1	a	 stage2 and 3 implementation of direct access to issuing bodies and further description of interfaces to provide structural data of evidence and context specific data 
4998	1	a	 stage 2 and 3 the provision of data of evidence and context specific data of electronic attestations in order to approve attestations easily 
4999	1	a	 stage 2 and 3 agreement on structural data of evidence and context specific data and description of national subsets of it in order to avoid the delivery of translations 
5000	1	a	 stage 3 possibilities to update a vcd and therewith enabling the national vcd service provider to 
5001	1	a	take the role of a validation point in order to implement article 52 of directive 2004 18 ec 
5002	1	a	providing on demand access to evidence requires the necessity to establish a national vcd service provider which is electronically connected to all attestation providers in the economic operator s country 
5003	1	a	in order to avoid the necessity to establish a connectivity matrix from all contracting authorities to all attestation providers the national vcd service provider has to act as a proxy 
5004	1	a	imply to set up and share common access policies 
5005	1	a	the definition of pull models between those entities would allow several opportunities and flexibilities for example to update expired evidence or to request evidence on individual basis 
5006	1	a	an organisational solution is necessary to solve conflicts that may appear when a contracting authority requesting attestations on individual basis and does not believe on the validation value given by the p e n d i n g e c 
5007	1	a	this could potentially include conflict resolution in cases of errors or when an economic operator has to produce a translation of the attestation in a certain period of time and to send it to the contracting authority via the national vcd service provider 
5008	1	a	thinking about the future we can imagine a scenario assisting the contracting authorities in lowering burden of validating attestations and lowering the burden for economic operators to provide attestations 
5009	1	a	a real added value in etendering processes would be to reach a state where contracting authorities could only focus on the offer and where the main purpose of a vcd networked package is in trusting in its status ensured by a national vcd service provider 
5010	1	a	nevertheless stage 4 provides guidance in how to connect both ideas in an easy way 
5011	1	a	the organizational framework then refers to the processes by which different organizations such as different public administrations collaborate to achieve their mutually agreed egovernment service related goals 
5012	1	a	to avoid problems of involvement a clear approach of stakeholder analysis is needed 
5013	1	a	wp2 can only provide guidance to this since it will be a national responsibility 
5014	1	a	each member state has to define its own strategy to involve stakeholders during the lifetime of the project 
5015	1	a	wp2 has developed a template for stakeholder management that may provide guidance for this 
5016	1	a	to ensure a wide acceptance of the solutions provided by wp2 among stakeholders we have to prevent changes in national procedures and infrastructures but to utilize them as much as possible 
5017	1	a	in stages 2 3 and 4 it will be necessary to establish a national service provider who will take care about critical vcd processes and therewith ensure legitimacy trust and appropriate change management 
5018	1	a	a national vcd application may list several different issuing bodies that provide the same attestation 
5019	1	a	these may have different characteristics as for example price availability or delivery time 
5020	1	a	to enable automated information processing on the basis of the pre vcd mapping tool within national solutions additional structured information has to be defined within the call for tender that enables the retrieval of qualification and selection criteria from contracting authorities 
5021	1	a	a contracting authority therefore has to specify a relevant criteria subset within a call for tender which can then for example be referred to by an economic operator by providing the i d of a call for tender to the national solution 
5022	1	a	in most cases we do not see great efforts for economic operators in two phased since many countries only required the submission of self declarations 
5023	1	a	thus the vcd itself provides support for the proofing of conformance but it does not provide any information whether an economic operator is conform 
5024	1	a	the requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed and specified in the project lifetime in order to further draft the organisational framework for a vcd to a greater extend 
5025	1	a	3 1 2 1 list of recognized public attestation bodies description article 52 describes that member states may introduce either official lists of approved contractors suppliers or service providers or certification by certification bodies established in public or private law 
5026	1	a	description article 52 describes that member states may introduce either official lists of approved contractors suppliers or service providers or certification by certification bodies established in public or private law 
5027	1	a	requirement any national pilot solution that will be developed in the context of peppol wp2 has to follow the pre vcd mapping defined in stage 1 
5028	1	a	the european vcd service provider will maintain the common descriptions and monitor the development of the national solutions and assess their conformance to a common european interface i e the pre vcd mapping tool 
5029	1	a	3 1 2 7 scope with regard to article 52 description article 5214 describes that eu member states may introduce either official lists of approved contractors suppliers or service providers or certification by certification bodies established in public or private law 
5030	1	a	stage 4 is providing a good opportunity to implement article 52 
5031	1	a	requirement a national pilot solution may implement attestation validation feature but proof of conformance and checking is not a mandatory feature that has to be fulfilled by a national service provider 
5032	1	a	measurement national service provider does not have to approve the documents submitted by economic operators requirement 
5033	1	a	if an economic operator decides to participate in a particular call for tender he can directly retrieve the relevant criteria and evidences by using the 14 the efta eea committee decision 68 2006 gives similar lists for the efta countries 
5034	1	a	in cases below threshold the economic operator might send a direct request to the contracting authority in order to retrieve the required information 
5035	1	a	the economic operator therefore has to provide a subset of the superset of evidences that is relevant to a specific call for tender to its national service provider or vcd system 
5036	1	a	a national pilot vcd solution may support the pre submission of evidence as well 
5037	1	a	the requestor has to decide by himself which issuing service is most appropriate to satisfy his needs 
5038	1	a	requirement if there are multiple ways to provide evidence the choice of selecting a specific issuing service is left to the requester 
5039	1	a	often the vcd system will have the possibility to specify the issuing services that are needed to evidence certain criteria e g candidate statements or attestations from third parties that are not available in electronic format 
5040	1	a	measurement functionality and interface that enable economic operator to upload any kind of evidence to the vcd 
5041	1	a	traditionally only larger organizations have been able to take advantage of e business primarily due to the cost barrier 
5042	1	a	although a vcd does not include the offer itself it provides several documents that are of great importance for the award of contracts and therewith critical for the success of an economic operator for example in cases of disqualification because of late delivery of a vcd 
5043	1	a	with the consideration of data object and document flow a disambiguation of the terms used is reasonable to clarify the concepts 
5044	1	a	official documents need to fulfil specific requirements like completeness integrity and transparency 
5045	1	a	apart from this they also need to conform to the legality principle of administrative actions and to audit trails 
5046	1	a	the goal is to keep the content available and traceable at any time 
5047	1	a	 evidences attestations and candidate statements translations translation of attestations in order to provide solutions for these different perspectives each one needs to be analysed and further defined 
5048	1	a	to further clarify their interrelation we take the research by russel n hofsteded a h m 
5049	1	a	crossing the borders of one system and organisation means have to be available to ensure the needed visibility 
5050	1	a	most data interaction appears on two forms see table 8 for more details one component sends data unscheduled to another one push one component receives data unscheduled pull table 8 cross organisational data interaction workflow constr 
5051	1	a	data transfer adds the view on how to pass data between components to the dimension of data interaction 
5052	1	a	transfer description cross org analysis by value a workflow component send or receives required information by having only data values transported 
5053	1	a	no need for a common naming a common structure of data elements or common address space by reference a reference to a commonly accessible location is used to communicate data elements 
5054	1	a	the label can give access to contextual information like a country s legislation and constraints valid for the very document 
5055	1	a	the methodology of iso 11179 will be used for specifications that can be used to detail the profiles developed by cen bii wg 1 
5056	1	a	the requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed and specified in the project lifetime in order to further draft the semantic framework for a vcd to a greater extend 
5057	1	a	from a very pragmatic point of view it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of attestations in a first step and to complete the vcd package later on 
5058	1	a	it is also reasonably to define where and when permitted a default packaging list of tender independent criteria to be served without the burden of reading or interpreting the call for tender 
5059	1	a	requirement any vcd system provides the functionality to add additional documents through placeholders 
5060	1	a	therefore interfaces to submit evidence to the vcd system have to be defined 
5061	1	a	measurement visualization of the vcd package 3 2 4 8 implementation approach with regard to stages of maturity description the implementation of different stages of maturity requires a general approach that defines which parts are mandatory and ensure semantic interoperability of vcd packages 
5062	1	a	the economic operator has to provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order to proof its economic or financial standing in this case the whole attestation balance sheet or extracts of it has to be delivered 
5063	1	a	classification schemes and code lists conveys semantics to the objects so they are a key factor to achieve semantic interoperability 
5064	1	a	supporting pan european procurement and implementing services to enable pan european deployment of evidences is the major goal of peppol wp2 
5065	1	a	therefore a comprehensive analysis of the relevant legal regulation has to take place 
5066	1	a	to get an overview on the legal requirements and regulations on different levels the following sources have to be analysed 
5067	1	a	the recommended process to extract the legal requirements of a vcd service or vcd service provider follows the maturity path defined within wp 2 starting with the status quo and ending up with stage 4 
5068	1	a	a set of 40 legal questions has been developed in order to describe the national legal environment with regard to the relevant articles of the above mentioned directive and to draw conclusions from it 
5069	1	a	the requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed and specified in order to further draft the legal framework for a vcd to a greater extent 
5070	1	a	therefore article 52 5 states that economic operators from other member states may not be obliged to undergo such registration or certification in order to participate in a public contract 
5071	1	a	it has to be defined whether a vcd package can have its own validity or if its validity is only based on the contained information 
5072	1	a	the provision of attestations that are available in context specific formats including multi lingual versions and their transformation into any target language has to guarantee similar legal status and effect is reached compared to official translation 
5073	1	a	if an economic operator decides to participate in a particular procurement procedure he can directly retrieve the relevant criteria by using the information published in the contract notice 
5074	1	a	in cases below threshold the economic operator might send a direct request to the procurer in order to retrieve the required information 
5075	1	a	does mutual recognition provide support to p e n d i n 
5076	1	a	thus only the economic operators from member states where such attestations are available can provide these attestations 
5077	1	a	other economic operators have to provide similar evidence instead e g a candidate statement 
5078	1	a	the working group has to provide a concept of how each possible attestation has to be fulfilled mapping of evidences defined in the directive with national implementation 
5079	1	a	in order to achieve good mapping results it has to be p e n d i n 
5080	1	a	a ms decides to exchange validation values e g certified yes no statements instead of delivering an attestation physically stage 4 specific

5083	1	a	3 3 2 8 2 national service providers description this section contains requirements concerning a national service provider who may host services necessary to ensure sustainable interoperability of a national vcd solution in long term 
5084	1	a	it is not allowed to directly issue an extract from the register of conviction to the economic operator but to directly deliver these evidence to the requesting authority 
5085	1	a	data protection is the main piece of legislation that governs the protection of personal or entity related data in a way in which individuals or entities can enforce the control of information about themselves 
5086	1	a	trust models have to be defined for each process in order to clarify roles and responsibilities during transactions
5087	1	a	this may include on a national level the definition of trust with regard to roles and responsibilities between national service providers and issuing bodies public private 
5088	1	a	on the european level it may include the scope of mutual recognition for example the trust between the national service provider who provides a vcd simple package and the european service provider who provides a particular mapping facility 
5089	1	a	moreover the existence of voluntary accreditation schemes could constitute a favourable framework for enhancing the level of certification service provision for these devices 
5090	1	a	hence it has to be ensured that only those persons that have sufficient rights are able to access and retrieve these data 
5091	1	a	authentication is a verification of evidence of identity for individuals and companies identifiers are used to process authentication 
5092	1	a	we also see a potential need to access web services via the infrastructure that enable client side code generation in soap frameworks for example for the retrieval of attestations on demand connecting to tendering platforms or viewing the vcd on some platform at the national service provider 
5093	1	a	the requirements have to be fulfilled or further analysed and specified with in conjunction with wp1 and wp8 in order to further draft the technical framework with regard to the vcd

5115	1	a	they are referring to it will be firstly possible to set up a database with common definitions that referring to evidences and secondly to define precise mapping between those evidences via the templates 
5116	1	a	the next section provides an overview of relevant technologies that may enable such a mapping of evidence 
5117	1	a	therefore wp 2 proposes to derive criteria from the european directive 2004 18 ec as shown for instance within the eligibility of tenderers 
5118	1	a	alignment is used to find classes of data that are semantically equivalent but indeed not necessarily logically identical e g extracts of judicial records or equivalent documents 
5119	1	a	 enable translation refers to syntactic rewriting and semantic rewriting to support the translation between two different representations of data 
5120	1	a	formal semantics enables users to share and integrate information easily by using descriptive technologies like the resource description framework rdf the web ontology language owl and the data centric extensible markup language xml 
5121	1	a	they are combined to give a well defined meaning to the information and data exchanged in order to provide machine readable descriptions and to enable machine to machine communication 
5122	1	a	the semantic theory therewith provides mechanisms to enable semantic interoperability between heterogeneous systems
5123	1	a	 for enabling machines to process data directly 
5124	1	a	uris using a global naming convention to identify resources thus they are central for semantic interoperability 
5125	1	a	resources are associated with a uri so that anyone can link refer to it and may access an appropriate representation of it 
5126	1	a	however xml and its schema languages do not express the meaning of the content but rather structure e g nesting information 
5127	1	a	xml documents are usually based on different schemas but they may represent data with similar semantics 
5128	1	a	the rdf metadata model allows to define statements about resources by using so called triple stores subject predicate object expressions 
5129	1	a	resources in rdf are connected to specific uris that allow to derive information about the resource and its meaning
5130	1	a	 owl is designed to enable applications to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans 
5131	1	a	the main idea of owl is to support an efficient representation of ontologies as well as the support of decision procedures 
5132	1	a	owl allows to refer to terms in other ontologies and it uses the linking provided by rdf to enable the distribution of ontologies among different systems logical reasoning is needed to ensure the consistency and correctness of data sets 
5133	1	a	proofs are needed in order to trace the steps of logical reasoning21 
5134	1	a	the layers above rdf are the subject to many prototype systems that are built to enable a higher degree of semantic interoperability between heterogeneous systems 
5135	1	a	in the initial description of work austria and italy have planned pilot implementations of stages 2 see subsequent sections 4 3 and 4 4 for more detailed descriptions of the austrian and italian pilot implementations 
5136	1	a	this ontology is the logic basis in order to orchestrate the necessary services collecting the required evidences for a given tender 
5137	1	a	the ui component will provide the users with a web client interface in order to support smes the best way possible 
5138	1	a	this component interprets the international rule set ontology generates a list of service to be called in order to furnish the required evidences for the given criteria and passes the resulting service chain to the soa engine 
5139	1	a	the piloting approach is to change as few existing evidence issuing processes as possible in a first step in order to quickly bring the vcd implementation into production 
5140	1	a	4 4 italian implementation and piloting proposal 4 4 1 implementation approach italy plans to adapt its current company s dossier builder to the design and implementation principles set by peppol wp2 
5141	1	a	for peppol s project runtime italy is planning to reach stage 2 as ultimate stage in its system and services evolution along with solid contributions for the analysis and design of the upper level stages 
5142	1	a	effort will be spent on refining and consolidating the document s acquisition infrastructure that represents a multi site networking system to reach the different certification authorities that are the authoritative suppliers of documents essential to the vcd package construction 
5143	1	a	the piloting phase of the italian vcd service will include the technical actions identified by the implementation plan and some interfacing events to reach selected stakeholders and define through their input the driving conditions for the vcd setup 
5144	1	a	level of completeness a vcd package will show its full potential when all the requested attestations all that are necessary to prove all requested criteria are contained in it 
5145	1	a	the vcd promotes a step wise approach in order to reach a sufficient level of completeness by concentrating first on evidences with regard to articles 45 46 and afterwards on evidences with regard to articles 47 50 
5146	1	a	the paradigm shift refers to the handling of documents to handling of information and electronic exchange of information in order to establish interoperability on the basis of mutual recognition 
5147	1	a	tender specific requirements then have to be stated by contracting authorities according to the european criteria during notification phase in order to derive tender specific mapping results on evidences required to submit at tendering subset 
5148	1	a	vcd services are capable to collect evidences from different sources and compiling vcd packages from it 
5149	1	a	types of data contained in a vcd provide the basis for a common structure of a vcd includes several data types cf 
5150	1	a	glossary to build the vcd from different sources and formats e g tender specific data that refer to a particular call for tender the evidences itself as electronic file or scanned copy and structural data of evidence that describe the evidences according to generic aspects 
5151	1	a	economic operators are for example enabled to maintain their data through re compilation of a vcd or to merge their vcd with vcds from other economic operators in order to create groups of economic operators for bidding consortia 
5152	1	a	therefore national service providers have to store attestations and referencing to it within the vcd 
5153	1	a	contracting authorities are mandated to request attestations in individual cases on demand 
5154	1	a	the technical framework lists several requirements that are essential to specify the technical transportation validation basis in order to submit any wp2 solution across borders 
5155	1	a	5 2 vcd concept and its strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot analysis is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of a project or intention 
5156	1	a	the aim of any swot analysis is to identify the key internal and external factors that influence the achievements of this objective 
5157	1	a	what may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses for another objective 
5158	1	a	the external factors may include market opportunities and threats technological change legislation and political considerations22 
5159	1	a	5 2 1 strength of the vcd concepts the major objective of this deliverable is to develop a concept for a vcd and to define major requirements that shape this vcd concept 
5160	1	a	with the staged maturity model we intend to reach a wide flexibility and openness of such a solution encompassing all member states to implement their individual preferences 
5161	1	a	beside we defined a set of requirements on organisational semantic technical and legal level that clarify general aspect of vcd development and deployment to support the mutual recognition of evidences across border 
5162	1	a	if the contracting authority specifies the relevant evidences which are related to criteria the data can be processed automatically in order to look up the evidences required within another member state 
5163	1	a	a vcd provides a single point of contact for an economic operator that enables him to invoke and manage different services to create a vcd 
5164	1	a	structural data of evidence will provide guidance for foreign contracting authorities to understand the evidences contained within a vcd and they can trust that general information since it is provided by national vcd service providers that take the role of trusted parties 
5165	1	a	context specific data will be provided on the higher levels to increase decision support 
5166	1	a	furthermore we rely on structural data of evidences that describe and characterize evidence from a more generic point of view 
5167	1	a	the possibility to replace the full document translation with a selective translation through context specific data keywords and major contents bares certain risks 
5168	1	a	provision of context specific data is a precondition to establish direct information exchange between attestation providers and contracting authorities 
5169	1	a	this direct information exchange would provide many opportunities with regard to increase the actuality of evidence to lower the transaction costs of the parties involved and to reduce the time to create a vcd 
5170	1	a	to circumvent these problems the vcd provides in particular in stage 4 a guideline on how to move forward in order to reach this ambitious aim but it will not be a major focus of a vcd as such 
5171	1	a	thus the vcd system will be primary a tool for the economic operator to arrange a vcd package instance which is conform according to the requirements stated in particular call for tender which he can fill through additional inputs 
5172	1	a	it needs to be further defined how a vcd can support countries that have implemented article 52 but since there are currently no pilots in our work package that have such procedures already implemented we have left this out of scope 
5173	1	a	nevertheless we see a great opportunity to combine both ideas as shown in stage 4 
5174	1	a	the same burden lays on contracting authorities who have to check for each evidence whether the issuer has appropriate rights within that country to provide evidence 
5175	1	a	in contrast a vcd package contains the data necessary to prove the suitability of an economic operator according to these requirements 
5176	1	a	therewith the vcd ease the overall procedure may raise the number of cases of cross border procurements and may raise possibilities for greater competition across borders 
5177	1	a	these requirements now have to be taken further into account in order to specify the vcd and implement the various stages 
5178	1	a	to facilitate management of the requirements they will be transformed into a spreadsheet with information as shown in table 11 
5179	1	a	further characteristics to evaluate the quality of requirements will be considered such as their determinability atomic character verifiability well defined measurement towards the fulfilment of a requirement traceability 
5180	1	a	software engineers thereby may design a software model for the mapping of evidences together with legal experts that ensure the legitimacy of such a model 
5181	1	a	furthermore we intend to work closely together cen bii workshop and dg markt including siemens time lex when drafting these models in order to ensure long term sustainability of the solution envisaged 
5182	1	a	they will also be fed back to the requirements and may enforce change to them 
5183	1	a	with the implementation of stage 1 the pre vcd mapping a first level of interoperability and facilitation to collect the necessary evidences for a public tender in another member state is supported 
5184	1	a	the project team is aware of the fact that the vcd concept conceptualised in this report is rather generous especially if we attempt to implement stage 4 of the vcd vision 
5185	1	a	consequently a recommendation is given to focus implementation on the pre vcd mapping tool for widespread application of a vcd at first hand 
5186	1	a	a statement given by a candidate can give evidence to a certain criterion under certain conditions 
5187	1	a	these data are necessary to establish automated decision support and providing a short summary of the contents of an evidence in multiple languages 
5188	1	a	issuing service validation value data necessary to provide validation results which are either directly extracted by manually checking an evidence or which are automatically derived from context specific data boolean value 
5189	1	a	if the suitability is confirmed the economic operator is included in a list of prequalified economic operators which can be referred to when following tenders omitting the need to submit the evidences again 
5190	1	a	contracting authorities can request evidences on individual requests 
5191	1	a	mapping tool a system supported service capable to map certain evidence to criteria 
5192	1	a	in public procurement the self declaration is often adopted during the pre qualification processes but it is also use to state other facts when submitting a bid 
5193	1	a	a vcd solution can fulfil several stages at the same time tenderer an economic operator who has submitted a tender shall be designated a tenderer 
5194	1	a	the virtual company dossier shall enable suppliers to collect evidences from existing registries and to submit those evidences electronically and assembled as information package to any public sector awarding entity in europe 
5195	1	a	different stages have been identified to denote different level of maturity of a vcd package pre vcd mapping stage1 vcd simple package stage2 vcd advanced package stage3 vcd network package stage4 vcd lifecycle the vcd lifecycle describes the different states a vcd package can have 
5196	1	a	to facilitate interoperability in etendering the european commission demands for a virtual company dossier vcd as an electronic cross border document solution that contains several formal certificates and attestations required for etendering 
5197	1	a	the vision here is to create a container holding documents that are seen as valid evidence in the contracting authority s country of origin 
5198	1	a	the duty to compose and supply such dossier can be assigned to different organizations across the different countries once that it takes an agreed structure 
5199	1	a	the purpose of this questionnaire is to clarify the national processing of attestations and certificates during public tendering procedures and to identify major requirements that derive from public procurement law 
5200	1	a	it is important for us to gain in depth knowledge of the domain and you can help by filling out the questionnaire

5220	1	a	questionnaire concerning the legal analysis the following questionnaire was used internally by the project partners to investigate specific legal aspects together with legal experts in their countries 
5221	1	a	the following questions helped to gather proper understanding of legal circumstances in collecting evidences who may be an economic operator 
5222	1	a	 what are the conditions under which the contracting authority may require production of evidence 
5223	1	a	 does the law provide for a possibility obligation to furnish evidence of suitability regarding authorisation reliability and capacity also through a third party register 
5224	1	a	what role do thresholds play in the suitability check

5260	1	a	1 3 3 courseware system courseware system is a piece of software meant to help facilitate electronic classroom management and provide for electronic grading assignment submission discussion and other learning tools 
5261	1	a	this document does not make any further reference to the moodle version 1 4 software requirements specification date 
5262	1	a	this document also forms the basis for continuing discussions with stakeholders and sponsors to enhance and further describe those requirements to be included in future enhancements to moodle 
5263	1	a	this information will serve as a framework for the current definition and future evolution of the university of puget sound s courseware system 
5264	1	a	we also intend to apply this document to moodle to determine whether we can implement some of the features that moodle lacks and our stakeholders find to be important 
5265	1	a	by no means is the university necessarily going to choose moodle as a courseware system but we want to use the platform to have a new learning experience and contribute back to a real product nonetheless 
5266	1	a	our goal is to refine parts of moodle to provide functionality that improves the overall learning experience of students at the university and helps professors to make students aware of new ways of presenting material 
5267	1	a	at present the university does not believe that blackboard is providing the functionality that students and faculty need to encourage learning 
5268	1	a	our stakeholder feedback was gathered to help us determine the requirements of a replacement courseware system and provide analysis of the feature set in other available solutions 
5269	1	a	they contribute minimally to the courses themselves but spend more time modifying the system s configuration and making appropriate updates 
5270	1	a	the goal was to define those requirements that describe the core functionality required to support and facilitate diverse methods of teaching at the university of puget sound 
5271	1	a	one of the fundamental tasks of the system is to allow actors to upload and manage files on certain pages of the system 
5272	1	a	these might include assignment submission pages forum pages wiki pages and announcement pages 
5273	1	a	for collaborative projects it becomes important for actors to be able to upload more than one file to a given page especially in the case of an assignment submission where the assignment might include multiple parts 
5274	1	a	one of the shortcomings of the current courseware system is that the foreign language department is unable to capture and track voice clips recorded by students for oral homework over the course of a student s education 
5275	1	a	this can be done one of two ways 1 the actor can be allowed to preview the voice clip before it is archived and determine whether or not he or she would like that clip to be archived or 2 a newly created voice clip can be automatically archived 
5276	1	a	the first option would allow the actor to throw out an audio clip that is deemed to be unsuitable or inappropriate for an assignment without having to take it out of an archive of voice clips 
5277	1	a	the second option would automatically archive a voice clip once submitted but would require that the actor interact with the archived file 
5278	1	a	thus if the actor chooses to delete the file it would need to be deleted from the archive of voice clips 
5279	1	a	this allows him or her to manage archived voice clips and to create a cohesive portfolio that actors in the role of professor can use to judge improvement over time 
5280	1	a	if actors are unable to be notified in some way of new content in moodle they are unable to efficiently keep track of a course s current affairs 
5281	1	a	actors in the course administrator role may not feel the need to provide web feeds for every page in their course 
5282	1	a	too many steps to complete basic actions such as submitting an assignment lead to frustration on the part of the actor 
5283	1	a	this way another actor can review the grade information if their moodle version 1 4 software requirements specification date 10 25 2007 confidential ed altorfer walker lindley chris haller stefan moluf 2007 page 12 score on an assignment has changed and they wish to dispute it 
5284	1	a	 there is no system that allows actors to receive sms or email notifications of changes to moodle pages such as assignments or announcements 
5285	1	a	it is not intended to demand the system maintain reliability or to require the system to be highly available 
5286	1	a	it is important that a substantial number of actors be able to access the system at the same time since a courseware system is important to the courses that employ it 
5287	1	a	this will reduce the number of fte hours spent maintaining the system and simplify maintenance tasks 
5288	1	a	i and phase ii the main goal of the warc tools project is to facilitate and promote the adoption of the warc

5640	1	a	in order to conduct operation and maintenance a system for supervision and control of the wind turbine s is essential as the wind turbines typically are located remotely and at far distance from the operator 
5641	1	a	the need for advanced functions is very modest as the primary role of the wind turbine s is to produce as much electricity as possible 
5642	1	a	the operational functions are used to present process or system information to an operator or to provide him the control e g by commands 
5643	1	a	access control is to elforsk page 12 allow the capability to restrict an authenticated client to a pre determined set of services and objects

5943	1	a	in the next section system features with their functional requirements are presented to highlight the major services provided by the intended product 
5944	1	a	the performance models to demonstrate the effects of peering and to predict user perceived performance 4 
5945	1	a	overall description 2 1 product perspective cdn peering allows different cdn providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise 
5946	1	a	it is formed by a set of autonomous cdns which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure for cooperation in order to virtualize multiple providers 
5947	1	a	it is expected that an effective peering arrangement between cdns would require multiple steps to occur 
5948	1	a	a cdn s reach and scale is limited by its ability to handle peak load cost of equipment scalable infrastructure and or demand for the increased coverage of its infrastructure 
5949	1	a	peering allows a particular cdn to achieve larger scale reach through resource sharing with other cdn s 
5950	1	a	it is triggered by an initialization request sent to the mediator under exceptional circumstances e g flash crowds when the primary cdn realizes that it can not handle a part of the workload on its web servers wss 
5951	1	a	therefore divergent policies are software requirements specification for page 3 internetworking of cdns through peering allowed that specify the information that can be shared during interaction through providing a certain level of visibility to preserve privacy 
5952	1	a	once the initiating cdn identifies its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between cdns the next step is to choose potential cdns to peer with 
5953	1	a	the mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local pa to discover external resources from peers 
5954	1	a	cdn peering protocols the next step is to configure the cdn peering protocols at the conduit of the respective cdns in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly specified through the negotiated relationships 
5955	1	a	on establishment of a peering arrangement these protocols also allow participating cdns to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer 
5956	1	a	operational management when the primary cdn acquires sufficient resources from the peers to meet its sla with the customer the new peering arrangement becomes operational 
5957	1	a	peering also enables the cdns to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships 
5958	1	a	decrease cost of web access increase qos through reduced latency reduce server load and bandwidth consumption by a particular cdn server thus improving the performance of content delivery 
5959	1	a	assists an existing cdn to alleviate congestions by detecting and handling short term load spikes i e flash crowds effectively 
5960	1	a	the operations performed by the product components 3 assist to realize the above goals 
5961	1	a	to satisfy both local and delegated slas and ensures that the terms of the slas are enforced 
5962	1	a	it works in conjunction with its local pa to discover external resources and to negotiate with other cdns 
5963	1	a	it helps in discovering local resources through enabling the web servers of cdn providers to register and publish their resource service and policy details 
5964	1	a	it is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with pas of other peers and to acquire resources from them 
5965	1	a	for instance a short term peering arrangement is to be automated to react within a tight time frame as it is unlikely that a human directed negotiation would occur quickly enough to satisfy the evolved niche

6700	1	a	1 introduction 1 1 purpose the purpose of this requirements specification is to provide a repository for the high level and detailed requirements governing the design of the clarus system 
6701	1	a	this document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system requirements including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system 
6702	1	a	sad system architectural description sdd system design document sgap solution to fill design gaps clarus system design deliverables figure 
6703	1	a	1 2 scope clarus is an initiative sponsored by the u s department of transportation u s dot to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations 
6704	1	a	 s surface to support more accurate forecasts 
6705	1	a	the intent of the clarus initiative is to demonstrate how an open and integrated approach to observational data management can be used to collect control the quality of and consolidate surface transportation environmental data 
6706	1	a	1 3 definitions acronyms and abbreviations this document may contain terms acronyms and abbreviations that are unfamiliar to the reader 
6707	1	a	some portions of the clarus concept of operations ref 12 have been incorporated in this document both for continuity of concept and to help identify the basis for the high level and detailed requirements 
6708	1	a	this section does not state specific requirements but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context 
6709	1	a	the primary recipients of this data will be weather service providers but any clarus participants would be able to receive data if they so chose 
6710	1	a	this concept of autonomous data sharing is comparable to the world wide web layer of the internet where organizations can publish information on web pages or browse and download information published by other organizations on the web 
6711	1	a	ownership of the data is retained by the organization that provided the data to clarus and the provider organization can restrict the dissemination of the data through data sharing agreements with the clarus program 
6712	1	a	while the participants may want to access the network through a one stop internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations ref 
6713	1	a	designers are free to explore centralized and de centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a one stop portal 
6714	1	a	2 2 system functions the clarus system will collect data from contributing members organize and quality check the data and then publish the data for use by service providers and other members of the network 
6715	1	a	2 the arrows in figure 3 do not indicate data flows they show the subject object orientation of the relationship 
6716	1	a	the volume of data involved in this process has the potential to become very large which leads to a significant challenge in developing a system that can effectively gather organize quality check and disseminate the data 
6717	1	a	figure 4 time horizons for weather data the average elapsed time for the autonomous layer varies as a result of configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within the operation of the system to collect the data 
6718	1	a	the clarus component includes the time required to communicate data from the autonomous layer to the clarus system import process as well as the time required to process the input data into storage structures 
6719	1	a	further the variation in the service provider component includes the time required to add other data to the clarus data and to perform the human and machine based product generation 
6720	1	a	for the purposes of defining the boundaries of these time horizons the following definitions apply average elapsed time is the estimated time for the process within a given layer or layer subdivision to take place 
6721	1	a	because a variety of users can derive benefit from the clarus system it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components 
6722	1	a	the autonomous layer is comprised of operational entities who utilize weather and transportation data to make plans decisions and or take action based upon sensor data within their control 
6723	1	a	the clarus layer lies between the autonomous and service providers layers and represents the nationwide system and architecture to accomplish the previously outlined goals of surface transportation environmental data collection and management 
6724	1	a	the service providers layer is composed of both public and private entities that provide basic and value added weather support services to support the weather information needs of the broader surface transportation community 
6725	1	a	the quality controlled data are not value added data but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds 
6726	1	a	additional service providers having direct access to clarus data resources include research organizations external agencies that may choose to archive clarus data and other related weather service providers 
6727	1	a	this group places considerable emphasis on the pavement specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions 
6728	1	a	additional data from this group may include closed circuit television cctv images road condition information and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application 
6729	1	a	these are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the clarus system and may receive quality controlled data from it 
6730	1	a	these are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the clarus system and may receive quality controlled data from it 
6731	1	a	 research this category incorporates federal academic and private sector researchers who are working to improve the state of knowledge and practice through the research of surface transportation weather 
6732	1	a	this category includes operational and non operational interests who choose to include the clarus data in their endeavors 
6733	1	a	an architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue 
6734	1	a	the inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the system to expand and add new data sources and end users 
6735	1	a	to maximize system uptime redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of the system 
6736	1	a	likewise participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system 
6737	1	a	several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect process and publish their data 
6738	1	a	assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location time date and data qualification tags 
6739	1	a	the availability format and precision of geo reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system 
6740	1	a	the availability format and precision of time date stamps could also present unusual problems for the data acquisition system particularly if contributing systems can not manage daylight savings time dst span time zones or span areas that do and do not participate in dst 
6741	1	a	a set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information 
6742	1	a	this arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing qch algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the clarus system 
6743	1	a	the schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors 
6744	1	a	quality rules set up by the configuration administration service are executed by the quality checking services to apply sets of computations on the environmental data stored in the qualified environmental data cache 
6745	1	a	multiple passes by the quality checking services on the qedc information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data 
6746	1	a	the qed services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end users 
6747	1	a	similarly the em services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers 
6748	1	a	it maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state quality rules and set ed retrieval schedules

6848	1	a	general description hats was developed to explore transformation based software development 
6849	1	a	the hats gui is intended to provide hats users with an intuitive graphical interface to the hats system 
6850	1	a	the purpose of hats is to perform program transformations in a provably correct fashion 
6851	1	a	this enables users to construct software by transforming a target program or simply a target written in an abstract language to a transformed output program written in a more concrete language by demonstrating that the transformations preserve the semantics of the target program 
6852	1	a	a transformation language program consists of sequences of transformation instructions and constructs to control the application of transformations 
6853	1	a	parser a parser program generated from the grammar and lexical specifications to parse transformation language program files and target files 
6854	1	a	the hats gui will also facilitate the parsing and execution of sequences of transformation language programs display error messages generated by hats sml and facilitate the display and exploration of transformation outputs in the form of sdts and pretty printed text 
6855	1	a	product features the hats gui shall provide a user with the ability to construct and use transformations 
6856	1	a	in order to expedite execution of transformations parsed versions of files can be saved 
6857	1	a	in addition to the output file the transformation language program may specify that debugging and error outputs 
6858	1	a	the hats gui will make a list of these files available to the user and allow the user to select files for display 
6859	1	a	there are three actors in this system a user hats sml and the host o s the user will access the hats gui primarily to apply transformations to target files

7086	1	a	a backup structure is also a requirement to save all the data in case of server of disk problems 
7087	1	a	to be able to achieve the least amount of software bugs we use a spiral model with 2 iterations 
7088	1	a	although this is a linux based platform it would be possible to relocate the pms to a server with a different os as long as all necessary software is available on it and some adjustments are made 
7089	1	a	because of the fact that this was not demanded by the customer we did not fully implement this feature in the pms 
7090	1	a	the purpose of this document is to describe the technical and operation requirements that meet the needs of the ceap watershed assessment studies as well as additional needs of researchers at the watershed sites and diverse outside users in adequate detail to provide the basis for the system design 
7091	1	a	the users review the document to ensure the documentation completely and accurately describes the intended functionality 
7092	1	a	the document is structured to follow ieee 830 1998 standards for recording system requirements 
7093	1	a	three additional ars watersheds may be added in the future to represent additional land uses 
7094	1	a	the basic requirement for stewards is to deliver consistent high quality data in support of the ceap watershed scale assessment from a one stop data portal to the ceap clients and in time the public at large 
7095	1	a	the data system will serve as a repository where diverse end users can access search analyze visualize and report various types of integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations 
7096	1	a	sites may chose to retain existing data management protocols or change location protocols to those of stewards 
7097	1	a	diverse end users can access search analyze visualize download and report various types of integrated watershed data contributed from the multiple locations 
7098	1	a	watershed uploaders staff in the watersheds who have responsibility to upload local data requiring write access to space allocated to their specific watershed 
7099	1	a	these users will need user password authentication to enable user settings management and to have access to data protected through the confidentiality agreements among agencies participating in ceap 
7100	1	a	these would have similar characteristics and needs as ars users but because of the agency level confidentiality issues could not access the password protected sensitive data 
7101	1	a	public users eventual release of the database system to the general public will add university and agency researchers who would appear similar in training to the primary users but also would add clients with the entire range of training and interests 
7102	1	a	these users would have access to the public data without need for authentication 
7103	1	a	oe 3 the data management portion of the system shall permit user access from the corporate intranet and if a user is authorized for outside access through the corporate firewall from an internet connection at the user s home 
7104	1	a	also it is required to test the application using different platforms connection speeds screen settings colors graphics and browsers 
7105	1	a	portability the application codes generated during prototyping may not run properly when re hosting the data system to a non windows os or transferring the data system to another location 
7106	1	a	the system shall use the current corporate standard microsoft sql server database engine 
7107	1	a	will contain sufficient information and instructions required to access and use the data system 
7108	1	a	it is anticipated that each watershed location will provide human and fiscal resources required to prepare metadata files data files work with the data team on initial import of data perform subsequent data uploads and provide site specific support to users of the system 
7109	1	a	if that funding were not available or insufficient in future years base funds at the locations and or discretionary funds from the area and headquarters funds would support the activity but the timelines would be adjusted 
7110	1	a	3 1 2 use case scenarios the team will elicit user requirements from a cross section of user class members see section 2 3 to accurately and completely describe the expected uses and functionality of the system 
7111	1	a	reporting of uncertainty may take place on an individual sample basis on a method or procedural basis or on an entire database 
7112	1	a	the current scope of the stewards system is to provide measured data for input to the model and for comparison to output 
7113	1	a	fr 2 1 view entire universe of watersheds from top level screen for selection design tools to navigate the individual watershed sites and their data 
7114	1	a	users may wish to examine time series data e g stream discharge data over a user specified time frame in order to select only those data desired for download 
7115	1	a	visualize query and download spatial data agricultural research data are inherently spatial in nature 
7116	1	a	these tools will provide browse and query functionality and support links to download spatial data and their associated tabular data 
7117	1	a	fr 2 7 browse visualize and download agricultural modeling data and results much of the initial effort in ceap will focus on the use of agricultural models e g swat annagnps in the ceap watersheds 
7118	1	a	users will be able to examine the data used in the modeling effort visualize the results in their spatial context and download the model input data and results 
7119	1	a	system requirements specification for stewards page 8 fr 3 metadata fr 3 1 maintain metadata database develop and maintain a metadata database that provides browse and query access to formal descriptions of the database elements 
7120	1	a	provide tools for database contributors to create and upload metadata compatible with the stewards metadata database 
7121	1	a	a likely scenario involves a web based wizard which allows users to specify particulars of a data set and then save those answers and relate them to a particular project so that these selections can be re used in future uploading operations 
7122	1	a	a likely scenario involves a web based wizard which allows users to specify particular querying parameters and then save them for reference later such that time based comparisons are facilitated with minimal user training 
7123	1	a	metadata database implement a database of stewards metadata elements 
7124	1	a	the system needs to be able to store hundreds of megabytes of data on demand 
7125	1	a	further requirements gathering is needed to get real world estimates of such data storage needs 
7126	1	a	private network the system requires a back end private network environment in order to ensure that end user operations on the front end are not impeded by database backups index propagations or other large back end data transfers 
7127	1	a	the purpose of quality assurance is intended to provide added assurance of data integrity 
7128	1	a	basic information may include spatial data in a gis compatible format descriptive data about stations instruments methods or procedures reports modeling results and other data 
7129	1	a	compliance by watershed staff is understood to be expected per obligations under ceap watershed project plans revised to accommodate the ceap project plan objective 1 
7130	1	a	3 6 4 data derivation aggregation the central database will allow users to access the data of individual watersheds sub watersheds on a station by station basis or a collection of stations if the entire dataset is desired 
7131	1	a	the system will have a simple interface consistent with industry standard interfaces to eliminate the need for user training of infrequent users 
7132	1	a	if the user requests a large image with a short response time it is acceptable for the ars data system to advise the user that the target response time can not be met 
7133	1	a	given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system rather than expend resources to prevent this loss such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated 
7134	1	a	scr 1 authentication stewards will follow industry best practices for authentication using single sign on systems like microsoft active directory to perform authentication 
7135	1	a	authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they are 
7136	1	a	13 confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately 
7137	1	a	stewards will use the user classes described in section 2 3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate 
7138	1	a	availability availability is defined here to mean the ability to use the system during its intended period of operation as defined in scr 4 above 
7139	1	a	authentication does not imply acceptance or responsibility for the specified item to perform successfully 
7140	1	a	benchmark watersheds is used to differentiate the larger scale ars watersheds from field scale ars research activity or from other non ars watersheds 
7141	1	a	the approach is easily adaptable to virtually any farming situation and can be fine tuned to meet your unique needs

7230	1	a	software_requirements_specification doc 1 applying broadcasting multicasting secured communication to agentmom in multi agent systems software requirements specification version 1 1 this document conforms to ieee std 830 1998 software requirements specification 
7231	1	a	1 1 purpose the purpose of this document is to describe functionality and behavior of the new agentmom framework 
7232	1	a	reorganization refers to a situation where the previous organization structure is not efficient to succeed the mission 
7233	1	a	group refers to a set of agents who agree to use the same multicast address to subscribe group message 
7234	1	a	1 4 0 is required to use the software 
7235	1	a	 tcp ip is used in order to send unicast message 
7236	1	a	multicast protocol is used in order to send multicast message 
7237	1	a	udp is used in order to send broadcast message 
7238	1	a	2 2 product functions 2 2 1 enable agents to broadcast a message to all the agents within the same local network 
7239	1	a	2 2 2 enable agents to multicast a message to all the agents within the same multicast address 
7240	1	a	2 2 3 enable agents to unicast a message to other agents within organization 
7241	1	a	2 2 5 allow agents to join and leave multicast group 
7242	1	a	2 3 user characteristics users who want to implement multi agent systems based on this framework are expected to have general knowledge of java programming object oriented programming and multi agent systems engineering methodology 
7243	1	a	2 4 4 broadcast message in many network only system administrator is allowed to send broadcast message 
7244	1	a	we assume that each agent knows the address of destinating agents in order to send unicast message 
7245	1	a	we assume that each agent has enough knowledge to decide the best way to communicate with the other agents 
7246	1	a	2 5 4 we assume that each agent knows the multicast address in order to send multicast message 
7247	1	a	an agent sends notify to join leave multicast group 
7248	1	a	for example agent_b and agent_d belong to the same group and then agent_b wants to leave the group and agent_a wants to join the group 
7249	1	a	in this situation when reorganization occurs agent_a who is previously not part of the group may send notify message to join the group and agent_b who is previously part of the group may send notify message to leave the group 
7250	1	a	for instance agent_b suffers a failure in one of its 6 capabilities and does not want to receive any further message from the group 
7251	1	a	agent_a who may have capability to substitute agent_b is needed to be part of the group 
7252	1	a	this involves sending notify of join and leave the group 
7253	1	a	message is decrypted only if message is encrypted in this situation agent_a wants to send a message to everyone within the group assuming that agent_a agent_b and agent_c subscribe to the same multicast address 
7254	1	a	this involves the multicast communication since other agents who do not belong to the group can not receive this message 
7255	1	a	for instance an agent may want to inform everyone in the group when the assigned tasks are completed 
7256	1	a	an agent may request a bid from other agents for doing some tasks 
7257	1	a	 send receive broadcast agent_a 
7258	1	a	other agent in the same local network receive message in this situation agent_a wants to send a message to everyone within the same local network that agent a belongs to 
7259	1	a	this involves the broadcast communication since any agent in the same local network as agent_a can receive this message 
7260	1	a	for instance when a new agent who does not previously exist in that local network wants to announce the existence to other agents 
7261	1	a	 agentmom shall support the ability to send request to join multicast group 
7262	1	a	 agentmom shall support the ability to send request to leave multicast group 
7263	1	a	3 2 4 3 agentmom shall allow an agent to decide whether or not to encrypt a message

7265	1	a	it provides porting guidelines and identifies the effort required to port the gui library to linux platform using gtk windowing toolkit for the x window system 
7266	1	a	it is licensed using the lgpl license so open software free software or commercial non free software can be developed using gtk without having to spend costs on licenses or royalties 
7267	1	a	wpi is explicitly designed to port windows functionality to os 2 presentation manager not the other way around 
7268	1	a	gtk api is similar neither to windows nor to os 2 api so it would be ineffective to extend the wpi library with gtk support 
7269	1	a	it will be an additional work for the programmer to add appropriate type definitions in a special file 
7270	1	a	there is no possibility in gtk to handle the windows or os 2 style resource files 
7271	1	a	gtk uses its own resource files which are very much different from those in windows or os 2 and allows to specify only styles and key bindings of the widgets 
7272	1	a	there is a possibility to overcome this issue to some extent by using libglade library which is used in gtk to build user interface described in the xml file 
7273	1	a	a utility can be written to extract all the necessary information from the windows os 2 resource files and present it in the xml format which can be handled by libglade to build a user interface 
7274	1	a	 mdi windows in window model gtk has no possibility to implement applications with mdi windows in window model 
7275	1	a	however it is possible to assign a parent for windows and they will be destroyed when the parent is closed 
7276	1	a	in case the target distribution does not support gtk at all or uses incompatible or older versions of the toolkit the library can be linked statically the drawback of this approach will be an increased size of the library 
7277	1	a	it is needed to use gdk_screen_get_width and gdk_screen_get_height applied to the result of gdk_screen_get_default in order to retrieve screen width and high instead of _ wpi_get_systemmetric 
7278	1	a	guiinitdialogfunc callback function the test dialog box used to get the dialog box font and client size information
7279	1	a	wpi_enddialog this function is used to dismiss a dialog 
7280	1	a	note that this does not destroy the dialog by default but only hides the dialog 
7281	1	a	os 2 like resource files and has no possibility to modify window 
7282	1	a	after the window is created it is necessary to put gtkscrolledwindow widget in it and then put gtkfixed widget in the scrolled window widget 
7283	1	a	standard sample the next objective is to run a standard watcom gui sample program located in gui sample samp2 c 
7284	1	a	gtk_window_create is needed to create a dialog 
7285	1	a	so it is needed to duplicate them in this function 
7286	1	a	gdk_window_process_updates can repaint the window in gtk 
7287	1	a	instead of using _ wpi_movewindow it is needed to use gtk_fixed_move to move the specified control in the fixed widget of window where the control is located 
7288	1	a	guienablecontrol sets control enabled or not enabled instead of using _ wpi_movewindow it is need to use gtk_fixed_move to move the specified control in the fixed widget of window where the control is located 
7289	1	a	open watcom linux port page 32 of 54 gui software requirements specification instead of using _ wpi_movewindow it is needed to use gtk_fixed_move to move the specified control in the fixed widget of window where the control is located 
7290	1	a	instead of using guigetrelrect it is needed to use g_object_get_property to read the coordinates of the control and use gtk_widget_get_size_request to get its size 
7291	1	a	 applied to a valid gtkentry widget to perform the operation 
7292	1	a	 applied to valid gtkentry widget to perform the operation 
7293	1	a	since the scroll bars behavior is automatic there is no possibility to set get scroll bar range values 
7294	1	a	in addition it is n t necessary to change vertical size of the bar because it is done automatically 
7295	1	a	to reverse the operation it is needed to make the gtkhandlebox visible and set parent of the gtktoobar to the gtkhandlebox widget 
7296	1	a	it is impossible to implement this function in gtk 
7297	1	a	gdk_window_process_updates can repaint the control obtained via guigetcontrolbyid 
7298	1	a	gdk_widget_queue_draw_area can repaint the window region 
7299	1	a	gdk_window_process_all_updates can repaint all windows 
7300	1	a	guibringtofront bring the window to the top of all others 
7301	1	a	this function makes no sense in gtk as it is impossible to implement an mdi in gtk 
7302	1	a	note that window managers are free to ignore the moving request most window managers ignore request for initial window positions instead using a user defined placement algorithm and honor requests after the window has already been shown 
7303	1	a	some code to convert bitmaps passed in function to some acceptable format will be needed 
7304	1	a	however as this function is called only in event callbacks it is possible to get the current shift state of the input device which initiated the event via gdk_keymap_translate_keyboard_state function 
7305	1	a	guigetrgbfromuser creates dialog to ask user for color returns its rgb 
7306	1	a	then it is needed to compare all the elements in the list with the selected item and find out number of the selected item 
7307	1	a	scott jecko 9 15 2009 1 4 document updated added basic requirement 1 27 ability for user to customize their view in the client application based on feedback from aeit advisory committee

7309	1	a	e a concise analysis of the ability of each sourcing option to meet major system requirements including federal and state requirements for confidentiality privacy and security 
7310	1	a	requirements workgroup methodology define the process by which requirements were gathered and grouped as either basic or extended 
7311	1	a	the primary objective for the requirements workgroup was to gather all functional requirements for the state e mail system via excel spreadsheet and compile all requirements into a complete concise and categorized functional requirements specification 
7312	1	a	note there are two subsequent surveys being sent out to gather current agency inventory and financial information the results of these two subsequent surveys are not included in this document 
7313	1	a	the survey also provided a section for agencies to address their concerns issues regarding a statewide e mail system

7441	1	a	to facilitate eu wide interoperability in public eprocurement the european commission co funds the peppol project in the ict policy support programme within the competiveness and innovation framework programme cip 
7442	1	a	in austria the current status is that each economic operator has to perform the full delivery of documents 
7443	1	a	this solution removes from the economic operator the duty and burden to get and submit these specific attestations 
7444	1	a	the efforts and expenses to develop a solution that ensures basic interoperability ought to be manageable and affordable member states who would like to advance their solution towards a higher level of interoperability can do so by adopting subsequent vcd maturity levels 
7445	1	a	vcd systems provide single point of contact to attestations from public sources and information necessary to prove conformance to a given call for tender 
7446	1	a	a vcd package may be linked to exactly one call for tender thus it is tender specific a vcd package may contain self declarations and several other documents provided by the economic operator 
7447	1	a	a vcd package will show its full potential when all the requested evidences all that are necessary to prove all requested criteria are contained in it 
7448	1	a	this would reduce the burden of reading or interpreting the call for tender but would increase the need for interpreting other requirements and would not ensure a high level of completeness of a vcd 
7449	1	a	one may decide to settle for the second level of support but focus on the most commonly used attestations a minimum for this level of support 
7450	1	a	thereby the status quo procedure of section 1 2 remains unchanged except that a pre vcd mapping exists which is implemented and provided through a european service provider9 see figure 5 
7451	1	a	to fulfill a first precondition for a vcd package as introduced in stages 2 and beyond the pre vcd mapping tool is the proposed function and the process that allows for its execution 
7452	1	a	besides the use of the pre vcd mapping in actual tendering and procurement procedures a system needs to be maintained which implements the mapping of european and national laws and the agreements of mutual recognition among member states see use case diagram depicted in figure 9 
7453	1	a	the articles 45 50 of the directive 2004 18 ec in order to ensure employment in pan european public procurement procedures 
7454	1	a	national requirements of qualitative selection and exclusion for qualitative selection and exclusion have to adequately represent the national legal conditions 
7455	1	a	in a first step all member states do have to establish a mapping of the criteria defined in the relevant eu directive 2004 18 ec to the national attestations giving evidence to these criteria 
7456	1	a	in order to achieve trust and an agreement on the mutual recognition of qualification documents as demanded in the directive all artefacts and mapping results that relate to the mapping of evidence have to be approved from a legal point of view 
7457	1	a	hence adoption and approval procedures have to be defined and enacted in order to install the pre vcd mapping and pre vcd mapping tool as an official mapping model 
7458	1	a	the adoption of the model requires a parallel effort from the legal side to compare whether the provisions of existing nppas can get a harmonization through the referencing to the eu directive 
7459	1	a	in order to derive sufficient mapping information the economic operator has to provide the criteria that are relevant to a particular call for tender 
7460	1	a	a powerful search mechanism is implemented to deliver good results when economic operators query the pre vcd mapping tool in order to understand what evidences he can deliver to confer to the selection and exclusion criteria set in a public tender in another member state 
7461	1	a	nevertheless this function will not be available for all kinds of attestation since there may be too many issuing bodies that provide attestations of the same type e g for criteria to prove the economic standing of a candidate or economic operator 
7462	1	a	the use case description of stage 2 contains several sub diagrams that describe interactions that are needed firstly to authenticate to the systems and secondly to create transport and view a vcd simple package 
7463	1	a	for example the logical systems identity and access management is strongly connected to the vcd system to the vcd viewing system and the vcd transportation system and in particular refers to peppol infrastructure proposed by wp8 and to already existing infrastructures within the member states 
7464	1	a	most member states require that evidences are provided in the target language thus a translator may have to translate evidences within the external vcd translation system 
7465	1	a	economic operators have to apply for a vcd account and therefore they have to provide sensitive economic operator data for example by uploading attestations to verify these data 
7466	1	a	after authentication the economic operator can provide further tender specific data to the vcd system e g ted i d in order to start the creation of a vcd simple package 
7467	1	a	the economic operator can submit the vcd simple package to the contraction authority by using the vcd transportation system which is part of the peppol infrastructure 
7468	1	a	after retrieving the vcd package from economic operators contracting authorities may have to authenticate to the vcd viewing system in order to view the vcd package 
7469	1	a	the vcd viewing system has to fulfil certain sub functionalities for displaying the different kinds of data that are contained within a vcd package 
7470	1	a	this feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces that are needed to manage a vcd account 
7471	1	a	requirements vcd account management an officer has to create a vcd account for the economic operator 
7472	1	a	this feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces that are needed to request a vcd instance that is addressing a particular call for tender 
7473	1	a	this feature describes the necessary functionalities and interfaces that are needed to arrange a vcd instance according to the needs of an economic operator 
7474	1	a	table 3 shows the additional benefits of stage 2 first stage in four stage vcd concept containing documents the major aim of stage 2 is to draft logical systems that enable economic operators to create simple vcd packages and to submit them to contracting authorities 
7475	1	a	 version 1 1 approved by ec have a very generic grounding for mapping defined through an abstract class of documents e g evidence with regards to environmental management standards 
7476	1	a	the usage of context specific data thereby is an important precondition since these data can provide real time information about the status of contents of the vcd which is needed in terms of making update proposals 
7477	1	a	in order to merge vcd packages of several economic operators acting as one economic operator e g a consortium contractor subcontractor relationships into one vcd package the economic operator has to be able to provide these vcd packages to the vcd system 
7478	1	a	the stage 2 collection process for evidence and structural evidence data has to be extended to include the collection and processing of context specific data 
7479	1	a	in order to merge vcd packages of several economic operators acting as a single economic operator e g a consortium contractor subcontractor relationships into one vcd package the vcd system has to be able to consider data from several existing vcd packages in the compilation process 
7480	1	a	the vcd creation service of stage 2 vcd simple package has to be improved in order to include the functionalities for considering context specific data and vcd merging 
7481	1	a	the provision of context specific data avoids the need for translating certain evidences that are available in electronic format and allow the description of its contents using the common standard schema of context specific data 
7482	1	a	stage 3 as a concept does not predetermine a solution where all evidences are provided electronically in machine interpretable form 
7483	1	a	stage 4 allows further implementations towards federated networks and provides opportunities to establish lists of approved economic operators in accordance with article 52 1 of directive 2004 18 ec11 
7484	1	a	stage 4 does not contain a modelled use case diagram that clarifies the system interaction and a detailed description of requirements because it mainly relies on the functions introduced in the previous stages and there are no pilots yet for this stage 
7485	1	a	when all attestations are compiled by the vcd system the economic operator can submit its vcd to the contracting authority 
7486	1	a	stage2 and 3 implementation of direct access to issuing bodies and further description of interfaces to provide structural data of evidence and context specific data 
7487	1	a	stage 2 and 3 the provision of data of evidence and context specific data of electronic attestations in order to approve attestations easily 
7488	1	a	stage 2 and 3 agreement on structural data of evidence and context specific data and description of national subsets of it in order to avoid the delivery of translations 
7489	1	a	for example a balance sheet could be much more easily represented electronically if a specific tender would only demand to fulfil a certain range of capital e g until 1 million from 1 million to 10 that has to be met by the economic operator 
7490	1	a	stage 3 possibilities to update a vcd and therewith enabling the national vcd service provider to take the role of a validation point in order to implement article 52 of directive 2004 18 ec 
7491	1	a	the relations between entities shown in the figure above imply to set up and share common access policies 
7492	1	a	an organisational solution is necessary to solve conflicts that may appear when a contracting authority requesting attestations on individual basis and does not believe on the validation value given by the vcd 
7493	1	a	measurement list of recognized public attestation bodies in vcd index description article 52 describes that member states may introduce either official lists of approved contractors suppliers or service providers or certification by certification bodies established in public or private law 
7494	1	a	measurement vcd packages need to provide mapping functionality with the pre vcd mapping tool description the implementation of a national vcd solution in stages 2 3 and 4 requires a wide degree of freedom in implementing this solution according to national conditions and requirements 
7495	1	a	description article 5215 describes that eu member states may introduce either official lists of approved contractors suppliers or service providers or certification by certification bodies established in public or private law 
7496	1	a	if an economic operator decides to participate in a particular call for tender he can directly retrieve the relevant criteria and evidences by using the information published in the call for tender 
7497	1	a	measurement functionality and interface that enable economic operator to upload any kind of evidence to the vcd description e business is relevant to organizations of any size 
7498	1	a	evidences attestations and candidate statements translations translation of attestations in order to provide solutions for these different perspectives each one needs to be analysed and further defined 
7499	1	a	most data interaction appears on two forms see table 8 for more details one component sends data unscheduled to another one push one component receives data unscheduled pull data transfer adds the view on how to pass data between components to the dimension of data interaction 
7500	1	a	requirement develop a format that allows the presentation and displaying of the contents of a vcd package 
7501	1	a	measurement visualization of the vcd package description the implementation of different stages of maturity requires a general approach that defines which parts are mandatory and ensure semantic interoperability of vcd packages 
7502	1	a	requirement if the prove concentrates on qualitative aspects e g provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order to proof its economic or financial standing then the validation value can not be applied 
7503	1	a	 classification schemes and code lists conveys semantics to the objects so they are a key factor to achieve semantic interoperability 
7504	1	a	when developing a solution the differences between national procurement acts and the european directive has to be taken into account in order to define a solution that is conform to national law and can be applied on a pan european level 
7505	1	a	requirement the provision of attestations that are available in context specific formats including multi lingual versions and their transformation into any target language has to guarantee similar legal status and effect is reached compared to official translation 
7506	1	a	does mutual recognition provide support to submit scanned copies to other member states which require official scans that are produces by dedicated public authority 
7507	1	a	measurement qualitative legal specification on the scope of mutual recognition description not every member state provides all attestations that are necessary for an economic operator to prove conformance with given criteria specified by another member state 
7508	1	a	in order to achieve good mapping results it has to be checked whether these articles are sufficiently implemented into national procurement law 
7509	1	a	this section contains requirements concerning a european service provider who may host services necessary to ensure sustainable interoperability between vcd solutions in long terms 
7510	1	a	measurement necessity for amendments of existing regulations has to be proofed description this section contains requirements concerning a national service provider who may host services necessary to ensure sustainable interoperability of a national vcd solution in long term 
7511	1	a	for example in some countries it is not allowed to directly issue an extract from the register of conviction to the economic operator but to directly deliver these evidence to the requesting authority 
7512	1	a	this may also include for example to submit a vcd package via the peppol infrastructure while submitting other parts or the bid itself via secondary channels or whether tendering platforms enable such separation 
7513	1	a	a governing model has to be defined in order to deploy the wp2 systems and tools and to maintain their states and sustainability over time 
7514	1	a	description member states are building electronic identity management systems as a key element in their national strategy to deploy electronic services 
7515	1	a	description to exchange electronic documents between parties in a cross border environment a major challenge is to find out the other party s address and to understand what are his systems capabilities and requirements 
7516	1	a	the vcd essentially relies on such validation service in order to guarantee data integrity and confidentially of a vcd cf

7631	1	a	1 2 scope clarus is an initiative sponsored by the federal highway administration fhwa to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations 
7632	1	a	1 provide a north american resource to collect quality control and make available surface transportation weather and road condition observations so that state departments of transportation dots can be more productive in maintaining safety and mobility on all roads 
7633	1	a	some portions of the clarus concept of operations ref 12 have been incorporated in this document both for continuity of concept and to help identify the basis for the high level requirements 
7634	1	a	descriptions of specific terms and acronyms used in this section may be found in appendix a 2 1 system perspective the clarus initiative is essentially a plan to create a network of networks 
7635	1	a	while the participants want to access the network through a one stop internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations 
7636	1	a	while some data retention is likely to be necessary to support the quality control function and the publication function there is a clear recognition that as the data age they lose value to all but climatological investigators and other researchers 
7637	1	a	2 2 system functions the clarus system will collect data from contributing members organize and qualify the data and then publish the data for use by service providers and other members of the network 
7638	1	a	figure 2 basic clarus system objects and functions the volume of data involved in this process has the potential to become very large which leads to a significant challenge in developing a system that can effectively gather organize and disseminate the data 
7639	1	a	figure 3 time horizons for weather data the average elapsed time for the autonomous layer varies as a result of configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within the operation of the system to collect the data 
7640	1	a	further the variation in the service provider component includes the time required to add other data to the clarus data and to perform the required human and machine based product generation 
7641	1	a	for the purposes of defining the boundaries of these time horizons the following definitions apply average elapsed time is the estimated time for the process within a given layer or layer sub division to take place 
7642	1	a	figure 4 clarus user layers and time horizon relationships the autonomous layer is comprised of operational entities who utilize weather and transportation data to make plans decisions and or take action based upon sensor data within their control
7643	1	a	these support services rely on clarus data raw and processed combined with other environmental road condition or traffic information products to develop or provide road weather information and enhanced products 
7644	1	a	this quality controlled data are not value added data but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality control thresholds 
7645	1	a	 transit these are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the clarus system and may receive quality controlled data from it 
7646	1	a	 archives this category includes operational and non operational interests who choose to include the clarus data in their endeavors 
7647	1	a	since clarus is not replacing any existing application the system is not currently critical to any operation or transportation function neither is it intended to support any critical national security missions 
7648	1	a	several assumptions have been made about how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect process and publish their data 
7649	1	a	this section presents the high level requirements for the clarus system and the associated institutional program necessary to achieve the needs and goals described by the concept of operations

7810	1	a	1 3 definitions acronyms and abbreviations 1 3 1 cluster cluster computing clustering involves connecting two or more computers together to take advantage of combined computational power and resources 
7811	1	a	hence a cluster works as an integrated collection of resources that can provide a single system image spanning all its nodes 
7812	1	a	currently there is no holistic scheduling mechanism in cluster computing to enable differing qos levels for different clients 
7813	1	a	we can modify this approach for our cluster by evaluating this credit priority according to the deadline and price constraints of users and considering the system load and resources use as well 
7814	1	a	this priority is then used by a scheduling policy to allocate resource proportionally to the competing jobs 
7815	1	a	jobs with more tickets have shorter strides and hence are scheduled more frequently and obtain a greater fraction of the resource 
7816	1	a	2 2 product functions the main purpose of the libra scheduler is to maximize user utility 
7817	1	a	thus the job details submitted by the user will include job prioritization criteria the allocated budget and the deadline required by the user enabling the scheduler to maximize cpu utilization while remaining within the constraints imposed by the need to optimize qos 
7818	1	a	2 3 user characteristics there are essentially two classes of users for the libra scheduler used with the sun grid engine cluster management system the user who wishes to submit jobs for the cluster and the administrator who oversees scheduling and cluster usage 
7819	1	a	2 4 constraints the current constraints on the project are related to the provision of hardware resources to implement and test a high performance cluster 
7820	1	a	 users are assumed to have a fair estimate of job execution times so that the decision to accept or reject a job is facilitated 
7821	1	a	first three features of the overall cluster management system and its interaction with the user or administrator are described submit job view job status delete change job 
7822	1	a	i d that needs to be used to submit a job to the cluster 
7823	1	a	job information about the job that the user wants to submit as well as already pending jobs to determine whether the cluster can accept more jobs and can cater to the particular user job 
7824	1	a	the cluster decides whether it is even open for job submissions and whether the user that is trying to submit job is a valid user or not 
7825	1	a	i d and password to ensure that only the appropriate user is able to see the job status 
7826	1	a	process selected options if choices are provided to the user to view different aspects of job information 
7827	1	a	3 1 3 1 introduction this feature may be available to both the user and the administrator to cancel a job or under specific circumstances change a job parameter 
7828	1	a	however if the user wishes to specify a different output directory or a delayed deadline this may be permitted 
7829	1	a	i d and password to ensure that only the appropriate user is able to delete change the job 
7830	1	a	revise scheduling decisions about resource allocation to pending jobs and submission of new jobs 
7831	1	a	it uses the stride scheduling algorithm to enforce resource allocations cpu cycles proportional to a user s budget and deadline 
7832	1	a	calculate the stride and the pass of the job where the stride is simply the global stride constant divided by the tickets and the pass is initially just the stride 
7833	1	a	thus the dispatcher decides when to actually send the job for execution 
7834	1	a	3 1 8 2 inputs the chosen execution host and queue on which to place the job for execution 
7835	1	a	there is no output associated with this feature as it simply performs an update and does not send any results back 
7836	1	a	3 2 4 security considerations the libra scheduler will ensure the privacy of user job status and ensure full control over job execution so that alteration of scheduling criteria or actual resource allocation is not possible without administrator authority 
7837	1	a	the maximum number of jobs schedulable is limited only by the capacity of the nodes to fulfill the jobs deadlines there is no upper limit inherent in the libra scheduler as such 
7838	1	a	3 6 online user documentation and help system requirements all documentation will be made in accordance with requirements pertaining to open source software under the gnu general purpose license 
7839	1	a	hence it will incorporate sge s interfaces for cpu usage memory usage swap file creation network communication 3 8 3 software interfaces 
7840	1	a	the key guiding principle behind the functional design of cctns v1 0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of investigation of crime and detection of criminals 
7841	1	a	the prosecution module of the cctns aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions 
7842	1	a	the search module of the cctns gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases 
7843	1	a	it also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminal accused or by cases 
7844	1	a	it makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting rti related etc 
7845	1	a	citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police 
7846	1	a	it improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork 
7847	1	a	the configuration module of the cctns helps keep the application configured according to the states requirements in addition to keeping data elements rules up to date 
7848	1	a	the requirements specify the requirements to control the user access to correspondences files and records and various functionalities provided within the system 
7849	1	a	 e g the displayed columns in the table move resize modify the appearance 
7850	1	a	application user interfaces to meet its requirements and recommendations 
7851	1	a	they can superimpose the primary window hiding relevant information 
7852	1	a	they could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility 
7853	1	a	this encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies 
7854	1	a	longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart 
7855	1	a	some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations color blindness 
7856	1	a	when frames are used it is important to title each frame and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other 
7857	1	a	the proposed functional architecture is modeled around centralized deployment to facilitate ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in open standards and web technologies 
7858	1	a	it also includes the product profile self declaration form to provide a format for documenting the features of the uk fishing vessel s electronic logbook supported by a product being submitted for the electronic logbook software system elss approval programme hereafter elss approval programme

8019	1	a	of course the xrt can not observe the burst for more than 30 minutes per orbit 
8020	1	a	under this scenario the xrt would generate about 10 mb of data per day for an average rate of about 1kbps which is well within the 3 9kbps average rate allocated to the xrt for science telemetry

8023	1	a	the edac can detect double bit errors 
8024	1	a	multiple bit errors two or more cause the software to reset the processor by discontinuing strobing of the watchdog timer which causes the watchdog timer to reset the board when it times out

8086	1	a	the goal of the srs is to provide a functional tool for guiding the development of controls and data acquisition systems in a manner consistent with their operation within the gemini system 
8087	1	a	this science plan may include interactive observing 
8088	1	a	they work with other users to determine appropriate observation scheduling changes maintenance down time and system modifications 
8089	1	a	it is from here that nightly operations would take place 
8090	1	a	the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility 
8091	1	a	programs as opposed to observers may have the capability of direct control of the telescope 
8092	1	a	this would allow the observer to create an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not allow the observer to enter for instance a command to slew the mount 
8093	1	a	this is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing and flexible scheduling as defined later in section 2 7 on page 2 12 
8094	1	a	depending on the operations implemented on the gemini 8 m telescopes they may become telescope operators operations supervisors of the gemini 8 m telescopes telescope and instrument operators and have to overview the gemini 8 m telescopes operation 
8095	1	a	they will supervise telescope operation and will be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments efficiently 
8096	1	a	if they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures have to be run 
8097	1	a	again the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility 
8098	1	a	at the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument requirements in this area 
8099	1	a	privileges software development and maintenance staff need the highest privilege in order to be able to modify everything in the system 
8100	1	a	operation mode software development and maintenance staff usually work at the test level see section 3 2 1 3 on page 3 4 for the part of the software under test 
8101	1	a	other parts of the gemini 8 m telescopes may also need to run in test mode to support integration tests 
8102	1	a	although there are two telescopes as part of the gemini system there are no plans to support concurrent use of them as if they were a single facility 
8103	1	a	they shall be able to work at all foreseen operation levels observing maintenance test see section 3 2 1 on page 3 3 
8104	1	a	the difﬁculty with offering such services as an externally supported standard as opposed to an internally supported standard is that decisions to change internal standards do not impact external users 
8105	1	a	it is probably not possible to establish a combined standard to which all instruments both gemini and visitor adhere to completely 
8106	1	a	it is much better to establish a subset of gemini facilities which will be made available to visitor instruments via long lived stable interfaces 
8107	1	a	the support of both gemini and visitor instruments would beneﬁt by the provision of a gemini observatory simulator 
8108	1	a	all other users wishing to monitor gemini 8 m telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by operations and get permission to do so 
8109	1	a	multi point monitoring allows them to follow directly the results of tests performed and investigate how the system is working e g by selecting different display pages with the up to date status information on different parts of the system 
8110	1	a	requirements normally executed with the sequencer by providing a computer executable program in order to make efﬁcient use of the gemini telescope 
8111	1	a	these rules have yet to be worked out one could imagine rules such as no more than 15 of observing will be preempted or a 10 overhead to the prime observing project is acceptable in order to pick up observations in similar parts of the sky with identical ﬁlters 
8112	1	a	it is assumed that the hardware involved in remote operations has been speciﬁed with sufﬁcient bandwidth to support remote operations 
8113	1	a	the choice of the name remote operations is meant to suggest an entire category of operations such as remote observing but also remote access for diagnostic support 
8114	1	a	it is required that the remote operations software be considered from the beginning in the gemini 8 m telescopes software design to avoid redesign later 
8115	1	a	remote observing as meant in this context does not mean remote control 
8116	1	a	the monitor s keyboard would not have any effect on the observer s environment remote monitoring 
8117	1	a	remote monitoring coincides to a large extent with multipoint monitoring but allows the remote user to pick and choose the information that is displayed on the remote screen 
8118	1	a	a remote observer might also need a real time video and voice link with the operator in the control room perhaps using a portable video camera which the operator can position as necessary 
8119	1	a	this might be necessary to back up local users expertise and to help in case of problems 
8120	1	a	at the same time one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra ﬂexibility of ground based astronomy 
8121	1	a	so whichever scheme is adopted to perform automatic sequences interaction shall be allowed at the desired level for example only on error conditions any time the user is allowed to break a sequence etc 
8122	1	a	flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling quickly exchanging observing programs 
8123	1	a	the goal of compression is to minimize bandwidth impact on the lan and wan and to save space on removable media 
8124	1	a	there is a ﬁrst level of storage within iocs to secure data in the event of link 
8125	1	a	critical resources those that can support only a restricted number of simultaneous uses are assigned solely through this allocation system 
8126	1	a	the telescope and instrument software shall contain built in test bit facilities to verify gemini 8 m telescopes system and gemini 8 m telescopes software performances 
8127	1	a	it may also prove useful to have multiple levels of fault notiﬁcation such as detailed verbose short etc 
8128	1	a	it is likely that different user interface modules see above would present different portions of this functionality to the user 
8129	1	a	this simulation may require a standard environment such as vxworks epics and vme crate cpu but it can not require any hardware speciﬁc to the application 
8130	1	a	replies might contain status information and in general data concerning instruments and telescopes to be stored together with the astronomical data 
8131	1	a	one can afford to retransmit commands in case of transmission error or collision but the protocol has to be predictable in that commands can not get lost and replies have to come back reliably 
8132	1	a	there will be parameters associated with each level of operation which deﬁne the status of the system and or control the system 
8133	1	a	it shall be possible to update all non protected parameter values i e those not used by operations at observing level 
8134	1	a	operation some tests might be run in parallel on instruments that do not have the light beam at that moment 
8135	1	a	the intent of a portability requirement is to facilitate migrating existing and future gemini systems to different hardware as the need arises 
8136	1	a	it is the current intent to limit the selection of computer hardware platforms to as few as is practical main processor computer hardware requirements will be deﬁned in the hardware constraints see section 3 4 2 on page 3 12 
8137	1	a	it is also essential to avoid software duplication and to simplify the gemini 8 m telescopes software 
8138	1	a	in order to make efﬁcient use of the telescope to support different observing modes and to support the versatility requirements some form of on line image or pixel quick look analysis is required 
8139	1	a	no distinction is made here between wan and point to point links as there shall be no difference in the software between the two cases 
8140	1	a	control data and astronomical data have already been deﬁned in the data speciﬁcations see section 3 1 on page 3 1 
8141	1	a	depending on funding it is probably reasonable here to make a minimum and a desirable speciﬁcation 
8142	1	a	reliability is deﬁned as the duration or probability of failure free performance under state conditions or the probability that an item can perform its intended function for a speciﬁed interval under stated conditions 
8143	1	a	the method of upgrading the system to add capabilities and performance 
8144	1	a	all subsystem software is to include modules to aid in the maintenance and testing of the subsystem 
8145	1	a	for example each subsystem is to include a simulator that provides a reference behavior for that subsystem 
8146	1	a	repair by unit replacement for instance an extra computer system repair units by module replacement e g replace a vme card in an ioc this could be done at an gemini 8 m telescopes base facility during the day 
8147	1	a	the gemini 8 m telescopes software shall be able to bring the gemini 8 m telescopes system quickly to a safe state upon detection of danger 
8148	1	a	it is acceptable and may well prove to be the best solution to provide intrusion security by a well designed network gateway acting as a ﬁrewall 
8149	1	a	minimize risks due to environmental conditions such as temperature noise vibration etc 
8150	1	a	minimize risks created by human error use interlocks and other protective devices when hazards can not be eliminated provide distinctive markings and warnings to protect people 
8151	1	a	built in test an integral capability of the mission equipment which provides an onboard automated test capability to detect diagnose or isolate system failures 
8152	1	a	however the ability to reconﬁgure the software if one actuator fails is desirable 
8153	1	a	data redundancy is also a requirement to prevent a single failure from causing the loss of collected data 
8154	1	a	the goal is to minimize the effects of single point errors throughout the system 
8155	1	a	as much as possible the system is to take advantage of parallel operation to improve efﬁciency 
8156	1	a	the purpose of this is to make the development process visible for quality and maintenance reasons avoid incomplete speciﬁcations discover errors early via review and audit procedures secure structured maintainable software guarantee software quality improve and ease cooperation 
8157	1	a	the development environment for the gemini 8 m telescopes software consists of the computer hardware and system software operating system languages and tools chosen optimally to support the development model presented in the previous section on life cycle aspects 
8158	1	a	one criteria is that sufﬁcient information be recorded during an observation to recreate the sequence of events that occurred during the observation 
8159	1	a	is is possible to enter interactive operation from automatic operation to handle exceptional conditions this is the normal mode of operation at maintenance and test levels 
8160	1	a	this does not include time to start up the telescope or instruments 
8161	1	a	the goal is to be able to recreate the steps in a observation from the system logs 
8162	1	a	serious errors require human intervention to restart full operation 
8163	1	a	normally there is no recovery possible from a fatal error except to shut down and then restart the subsystem 
8164	1	a	however in the case of an instrument failure it may be possible to continue operation by rescheduling to use observations that do not require that particular instrument for serious errors it may be possible to continue operation with degraded performance 
8165	1	a	the design is to use the techniques and diagrams introduced by ward and mellor and reviewed by the gemini staff 
8166	1	a	the upper levels user interface and ocs are assumed to not require a real time operating environment 
8167	1	a	however the operating environment at these levels is expected to provide sufﬁcient performance for both human interaction and communications 
8168	1	a	some packages such as gui interfaces and database interfaces have higher portability requirements that may require the speciﬁcation of higher level interfaces to the os 
8169	1	a	the gui systems are to use x windows version 11 release 5 x11r5 or release 6 x11r6 
8170	1	a	software interface between workstation and ioc is to use drama 
8171	1	a	 reliability manufacturer support and upgrade capability of the development systems will be considered when selecting the ﬁnal target systems 
8172	1	a	peripherals workstations are to have at least 2 gb of disk 
8173	1	a	the target ioc computer cards are not to be established until as late as possible to take advantage of technology advances while staying compatible with the development systems 
8174	1	a	in cases where there is a distributed network of target microprocessors involved at this level it is appropriate to provide a standard sub network 
8175	1	a	in cases where there is a distributed set of commercial equipment to be controlled the recommended method is to use an alan bradley system to control the equipment manually and interface to it using rs 422 or similar connection to an ioc 
8176	1	a	wherever possible gemini software is to take advantage of existing software 
8177	1	a	this helps reduce life cycle costs and maintenance efforts 
8178	1	a	this is a unix based workstation which can run various epics tools 
8179	1	a	database the heart of an ioc is a memory resident database together with various memory resident structures describing the contents of the database 
8180	1	a	databases scanning database scanning is the mechanism for deciding when to process a record 
8181	1	a	 a request can be made to process a record periodically 
8182	1	a	record support device support and device drivers in order to remove record speciﬁc knowledge from database access each record type has an associated record support module 
8183	1	a	similarly in order to remove device speciﬁc knowledge from record support each record type can have a set of device support modules 
8184	1	a	if the method of accessing hardware is complicated a device driver can be provided to shield the device support modules 
8185	1	a	many record types in particular all types not associated with hardware do not have device support or drivers 
8186	1	a	this design allows a particular installation and even a particular ioc within an installation to choose the set of record types device types and drivers it wishes to use 
8187	1	a	a mask can be set to specify value changes alarm state changes and or archive changes 
8188	1	a	because they are of interest only to channel access the monitor routines will not be described 
8189	1	a	each ioc provides a channel access server which is willing to establish communication with an arbitrary number of clients 
8190	1	a	display manager this tool reads one or more display list ﬁles created by edd establishes communication with all necessary iocs establishes monitors on process variables accepts operator control requests and updates the display to reﬂect all changes 
8191	1	a	this is a general purpose tool to acquire and save data from iocs 
8192	1	a	sequencer a tool which runs in an ioc or opi and emulates a ﬁnite state machine 
8193	1	a	other opi ca clients it is possible to interface preexisting software systems to the channel access library 
8194	1	a	this has been done for several commercial packages including idl pvwave mathematica and wingz to allow access and manipulation of epics process variables by these applications 
8195	1	a	build tools tools are available to create the various database components from ascii deﬁnition ﬁles 
8196	1	a	of course any application developer would be crazy to ignore tools such as medm or edd dm 
8197	1	a	the ocs may need a ca client that implements the ocs attribute value protocol 
8198	1	a	the dhs may need a ca client that gathers logging information 
8199	1	a	ioc database ioc snc programs files associated with opi channel access tools these would include medm adl display deﬁnition ﬁles pvwave idl scripts 
8200	1	a	tools applications work would then include any of ioc database ioc or opi snc programs files associated with opi channel access tools these are all topics that would be covered in an epics basics building and using applications course 
8201	1	a	not only would this simplify the integration with the central control system but would also provide a common environment for facility visitors 
8202	1	a	there are several means of transmitting commands and data across the gemini system direct a command source may directly specify the target subsystem 
8203	1	a	finally a channel might use a separate physical route to prevent large data transmissions say from interfering with the normal command streams 
8204	1	a	any subsystem may examine these communications and respond or ignore as appropriate 
8205	1	a	for example the ocs might broadcast a runtest command causing all subsystems to perform self testing 
8206	1	a	there are also control commands common to all gemini systems to provide speciﬁc functionality during observing 
8207	1	a	 queries used to obtain information about the state of the subsystem 
8208	1	a	a getstatus command can be used to determine the current status 
8209	1	a	setstatus the target subsystem is to enter the state associated with the speciﬁed status argument 
8210	1	a	for example setstatus simulation causes the targeted subsystem s to enter simulation mode 
8211	1	a	it is important that care be taken to avoid conﬁguration values that would result in motion etc 
8212	1	a	this command can operate with the getconﬁguration command given above to provide sequencing points for subsystem restarts or roll backs 
8213	1	a	communication via a route is typically asynchronous with commands available to establish synchronization as needed 
8214	1	a	the command includes sufﬁcient information on the route to permit the ioc to communicate through the route 
8215	1	a	modules receiving this command are to ﬂush buffers associated with this route and reset operating parameters to initial conditions 
8216	1	a	a callback is established to process data across the indicated route 
8217	1	a	the ioc system continues to transmit data values until a stopstream command is received 
8218	1	a	these commands are to permit appropriate time synchronizations 
8219	1	a	tbd some subsystems may need to obtain information from other systems within the gemini control system 
8220	1	a	statements within the fiche may comprise specifications which are binding on uic members obligatory specifications or optional recommended specifications 
8221	1	a	the functional identity can include characters and numbers 
8222	1	a	functional number the full number used within the functional addressing scheme to identify an end user system by function or role rather than by a specific item of radio equipment or user subscription 
8223	1	a	location dependent addressing a term used to describe the process of addressing a particular function typically a controller based on the current location of the user typically a train 
8224	1	a	multiple driver communications within the same train a term used to describe communications between the drivers of each active cab in a train comprising multiple traction vehicles 
8225	1	a	public emergency call a point to point voice call which is used to notify non railway authorities such as police and ambulance services of an emergency situation 
8226	1	a	secondary controllers require the facility to communicate with trains in all situations in order to perform their function 
8227	1	a	in this case a lookout is often required to report progress to the driver 
8228	1	a	a stock number may form a component of a functional number used to address users systems on an item of traction or rolling stock 
8229	1	a	for example such communications might involve the passage of catering maintenance or timetable information 
8230	1	a	for the purposes of this specification reference to train control also encompasses automatic train protection automatic train operation and in cab signalling 
8231	1	a	the scope of this specification is to provide interoperability for trains and staff crossing national or other borders between systems and to provide manufacturing economies of scale wherever practical 
8232	1	a	this specification is to ensure interoperability along international lines which are generally high speed and cross suburban areas with a high level of traffic 
8233	1	a	it is also important for this specification to provide an appropriate standard for future replacement of national radio systems operating on both important internal routes and low to medium traffic rural areas 
8234	1	a	these are statements intended to provide explanatory notes

8345	1	a	this introduction is also meant to convey the basic course of events that give the best understanding of the system
8346	1	a	the number portability administration center service management system npac sms is a hardware and software platform which contains the database of information required to effect the porting of telephone numbers 
8347	1	a	the npac sms shall also provide audit functionality and the ability to transmit lnp routing information to service providers to maintain synchronization of service provider s network elements that support lnp 
8348	1	a	the new service provider will obtain authorization to port the customer and notify the old service provider according to processes internal to the service providers 
8349	1	a	both the old and new service providers can send a notification to the npac sms from their service order administration systems soa 
8350	1	a	when the npac sms receives the notification s it will perform certain validation checks and attempt to match the notification received from the new service provider with a concurring notification that may be sent from the old service provider 
8351	1	a	when the new service provider due date is reached the new service provider can send an activation notice to the npac sms 
8352	1	a	in the case where either the old or new service providers did not send a notification to the npac sms the npac sms will notify the service provider from which it did not receive a notification that it is expecting a notification 
8353	1	a	if it was the new service provider that failed to respond the npac will log the failure to respond cancel the request and notify both service providers of the cancellation 
8354	1	a	processes for obtaining authorization from the customer to port a number are defined by the service providers 
8355	1	a	the npac is not involved in obtaining or verifying customer approval to port a tn 
8356	1	a	the npac sms will broadcast the update to all service providers based on the disconnect effective date and remove the telephone number from its database of ported numbers 
8357	1	a	1 2 4 conflict resolution functionality if service providers disagree on who will serve a particular line number the npac sms will place the request in the conflict state and notify both service providers of the conflict status and the status change cause code 
8358	1	a	the new service provider can cancel the subscription version 
8359	1	a	 the new service provider may send a message to the npac sms to cancel the subscription version 
8360	1	a	if a create subscription has been sent by only the old service provider the old service provider may send a message to the npac sms to cancel the subscription version 
8361	1	a	if both service providers have sent a create subscription either may send a message to the npac sms to cancel the subscription version 
8362	1	a	if both service providers concur with the cancellation the npac sms will set the subscription version to canceled and notify both service providers that the subscription version has been canceled 
8363	1	a	1 2 7 audit request functionality an audit function will be necessary for troubleshooting customer problems and also as a maintenance process to ensure subscription version data integrity across the entire lnp network 
8364	1	a	in a third scenario the npac sms will select a random sample of active subscription versions from its own database then compare those samples to the representation of that same data in the various local sms databases 
8365	1	a	all three of the methods outlined above are designed to help ensure data integrity across the lnp network 
8366	1	a	the report generation function creates output report files according to specified format definitions and distributes reports to output devices as requested 
8367	1	a	no assumptions are made about what the lsms does during the permissive period to track the npa nxx split for a subscription version 
8368	1	a	additionally the service providers can remove any old lrns that are no longer valid due to the split if any via an electronic interface soa lsms or npac administrative interface 
8369	1	a	the npac sms provides a mechanism that allows a service provider to recover messages sent to either the soa or lsms during a period of time that the service provider was not available to receive messages from the npac sms 
8370	1	a	once the recovery is finished the soa sends a recovery complete message to the npac sms which in turn triggers the npac sms to send the previously queued messages to the soa at the next normally scheduled retry interval 
8371	1	a	when an sp system sees this response the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the network data recovery action and re issue the request 
8372	1	a	when an sp system sees this response the suggested behavior is to reduce the time range requested in the subscription data recovery action and re issue the request

8761	1	a	this document is written for the researchers software developers advanced practitioners documentation writers and users involved in cdn domain to initiation an open discussion for exploring development opportunities regarding the internetworking between cdns 
8762	1	a	the final product enabling cdn peering assists in coordinated and cooperative content delivery via internetworking among distinct cdns to allow providers to rapidly scale out to meet both flash crowds and anticipated increases in demand and remove the need for a single cdn to provision resources 
8763	1	a	cdn peering allows different cdn providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise 
8764	1	a	therefore divergent policies are allowed that specify the information that can be shared during interaction through providing a certain level of visibility to preserve privacy 
8765	1	a	the software infrastructure enabling peering between cdns can be featured with the following major goals development and validation of peering and manage the complexity of content delivery across web servers of multiple cdns that scale across the globe 
8766	1	a	along with the software product a user manual would be written to help people understand the working methodology and usage of the developed prototype system 
8767	1	a	it is invoked when a primary cdn realizes that it can not handle a part of the workload on its ws s 
8768	1	a	exceptional circumstances such as flash crowds have occurred to place unanticipated load on cdn wss 
8769	1	a	else reject user requests 
8770	1	a	the pa of a given primary cdn negotiates with pas of the peers to perform external resource discovery 
8771	1	a	local pa communicates with the pas of peers to discover external resources 
8772	1	a	if any peering policies exist they are returned to establish long term peering arrangement 
8773	1	a	there is procedure to perform short term negotiation 
8774	1	a	if a peered cdn provider refuses to accept user requests a given peering arrangement ceases 
8775	1	a	policies are in place to perform renegotiation for problem resolution 
8776	1	a	as mentioned earlier the intended product to exploit existing web service technologies to leverage existing infrastructures through building an overlay 
8777	1	a	there is an urgent need for the eda industry to meet the exploding verification requirements of soc design teams 
8778	1	a	existing standard verification interfaces were designed to meet the needs of design teams of over 10 years ago 
8779	1	a	a new type of interface is needed to meet the verification challenges of the next 10 years 
8780	1	a	in the future sce api may be expanded to include additional parts to handle such features as debug and control code coverage etc 
8781	1	a	this document is intended to describe an overall use model of the sce mi a tutorial illustrating this use model and a formal functional specification of the sce mi api itself 
8782	1	a	it is hoped that the document will undergo a relatively quick evolution phase which culminates with a common industry standard that can be used by simulation and emulation tool vendors to provide plug and play high speed verification solutions to end users on soc design teams

8786	1	a	each communication channel is designed to transport untimed messages of arbitrary abstraction between its two end points or ports of a channel 
8787	1	a	these message channels are not meant to connect software models to each other but rather to connect software proxy models to message port interfaces on the hardware side of the design 
8788	1	a	although the software side of a system can be modeled at several different levels of abstraction including untimed cycle accurate and even gate level the focus of the sce mi is to interface purely untimed software models with an rtl or gate level dut 
8789	1	a	this can be summarized with the following recommendations regarding the api do not use it to bridge event based or sub cycle accurate simulation environments 
8790	1	a	similarly its hardware side is optimized to prevent undue throttling of an emulator during a co modeling session run 
8791	1	a	throughout this document the term emulation or emulator is used to denote a structural or rtl model of a dut running in an emulator rapid prototype or other simulation environment including software hdl simulators 
8792	1	a	that said however the focus of the design of this interface is to avoid communication bottlenecks that might become most apparent when interfacing software models to an emulator as compared to interfacing them to a slower software hdl simulator or even an hdl accelerator 
8793	1	a	such bottlenecks could severely compromise the performance of an emulator which is otherwise very fast 
8794	1	a	for this reason the communication channels described herein are message or transaction oriented rather than event oriented with the idea that a single message over a channel originating from a software model can trigger dozens to hundreds of clocked events in the hardware side of the channel 
8795	1	a	similarly it can take thousands of clocked events on the hardware side to generate the content of a message on a channel originating from the hardware that is ultimately destined for an untimed software model 
8796	1	a	also there is a good chance that any italicized text may have a definition in the glossary so the reader is directed there for a more detailed meaning of a term 
8797	1	a	this allows the transactor to freeze controlled time while performing message composition and decomposition operations 
8798	1	a	a special service loop function see section 4 3 3 6 on page 68 is provided by the sce mi that can be called from an application to give the sce mi infrastructure an opportunity to service its communication channels 
8799	1	a	in a single threaded environment the service loop function can be sprinkled throughout the application code at strategically placed points to allow it to frequently yield cpu cycles to the sce mi infrastructure so that it can service its messages channels 
8800	1	a	2 2 users of the interface a major goal of this specification is to address the needs of three target audiences each with a distinct interest in their use of the interface 
8801	1	a	rather on the hardware side they might wish to rely on the transactor implementor see next section to provide predefined transactor models that can directly interface to their dut 
8802	1	a	this would remove any requirement for them to be familiar with any of the sce mi hardware side interface macros see section 4 1 on page 46 except possibly the scemiclockport macro whose interface is easy to understand because all it really does is furnish a clock and a reset 
8803	1	a	such models would encapsulate the details of interfacing to the sce mi software side and might present a fully untimed easy to use interface to the rest of the software testbench 
8804	1	a	the job of the transactor implementor is to provide plug and play transactor models on the hardware side and proxy models on the software side that might be used by end users to easily bridge their untimed software models with their rtl represented dut 
8805	1	a	additionally the transactor implementor can supply proxy models on the software side that provide untimed sockets to the transactors 
8806	1	a	2 3 bridging levels of modeling abstraction the central goal of this specification is to provide an interface designed to bridge two modeling environments each of which supports a different level of modeling abstraction 
8807	1	a	such a configuration can be used to test a processor dut that has some communications interfaces that can include an ethernet adapter pci interface and a usb interface 
8808	1	a	f 94 functional requirements specification standard co emulation modeling interface sce mi overall description and use model figure 2 
8809	1	a	untimed software testbench and dut models now suppose that we ultimately want to create cycle accurate rtl models of the dut model and eventually synthesize it to gates that can be verified on a high speed emulation platform 
8810	1	a	the dut output proxies establish callbacks that monitor the message output port proxies for arrival of messages from the hardware side 
8811	1	a	meanwhile on the hardware side a message arriving on the message input channel can trigger many dozens to hundreds of clocks of event activity 
8812	1	a	it is the job of the transactor to perform this decomposition of message data content to sequences of clocked events that are presented to the dut hardware model inputs 
8813	1	a	any transactor can instruct the sce mi infrastructure to stop the controlled clock and thus cause controlled time to freeze 
8814	1	a	a transactor might need to stop the controlled clock when performing operations that involve decomposition or composition of transactions arriving from or going to a message channel 
8815	1	a	the compiled models are linked with the software side of the sce mi infrastructure to form an executable program 
8816	1	a	as part of this process the infrastructure linker also looks at the parameters specified on the instantiated interface macros in the user supplied bridge netlist and uses them to properly establish the dimensions of the interface 
8817	1	a	parameters passed to these calls establish a means by which specific message of 94 functional requirements specification standard co emulation modeling interface sce mi overall description and use model port proxies can rendezvous with its associated message port macro in the hardware 
8818	1	a	these compactly defined and simple to use macros fully present all necessary aspects of the interface to the transactors and the dut 
8819	1	a	such implementations would need to provide the rtc equivalents of the same macros defined in this specification 
8820	1	a	it is the job of the infrastructure linker to learn the values of these parameters and customize implementation components inserted underneath the macros accordingly 
8821	1	a	this scemiclockport macro instance will via a set of parameters fully characterize a particular clock 
8822	1	a	the numbers shown see figure 5 in the component instantiation label as 1 1 1 50 50 0 8 cclock map to the parameters defined for the scemiclockport macro see 4 1 4 on page 51 
8823	1	a	each origin transactor interfaces to a scemimessageinport to gain access to messages arriving from the software side 
8824	1	a	each destination transactor interfaces to a scemimessageoutport to send messages to the software side

8826	1	a	 sce mi user s guide and tutorial addressed to a particular hub to load the route into its routetable module see figure 9 on page 25 
8827	1	a	using this simple mechanism the software side routeconfig model progressively teaches each hub its routes via waltham so that it can in turn pass additional teachroute tokens to hubs more distant from waltham 
8828	1	a	in other words by first teaching closer hubs the routemap learns to pass routes bound for more distant hubs 
8829	1	a	it is the job of the transactor to count the number of clocks until the specified departure time before sending the token into the routemap mesh 
8830	1	a	3 2 3 1 bridge the bridge between the hardware and software side of the design is depicted in figure 7

8833	1	a	longer pipes can be created by cascading primitive one hour pipes to form the proper length 
8834	1	a	25 of 94 user s guide and tutorial 26 each origin transactor contains a clock control macro and a message input port macro to receive departure tokens from the scheduler on the software side 
8835	1	a	although the origin transactor has a clock control macro it does not actively control the clock 
8836	1	a	its only use of the clock control macro is to monitor the readyforcclock signal to know on which uclocks the cclock is active so that it can properly count cclocks until the scheduled departure time of a pending departure token 
8837	1	a	see section 3 2 3 4 on page 26 for a detailed description of the destination transactor

8842	1	a	when count gets down to 1 prepare to send a response that the time has expired 
8843	1	a	it is important to stress that systemc channels while conceptually the same are distinctly different from sce mi message channels 
8844	1	a	both types of channels pass messages but systemc channels are designed strictly to pass messages of arbitrary c data types between systemc modules 
8845	1	a	see reference 1 for more details about systemc interconnect channels 
8846	1	a	the thick round arrows in figure 10 represent the systemc autonomous threads contained in the testbench and scemidispatcher modules

8851	1	a	once the whole system is statically constructed models that interface with sce mi are given the master scemi object pointer so that they can access its methods by calling special bind accessor methods on those models 
8852	1	a	the scemidispatcher module contains an autonomous thread that yields to the sce mi infrastructure so that it may service its message port proxies by making repeated calls to the scemi serviceloop method see section 4 3 3 6 on page 68 
8853	1	a	its job is to look at the four passenger itineraries and schedule the legs in those itineraries on the appropriate dates and at the appropriate departure times by interacting with the scheduler model

8856	1	a	first by signaling the loadroutemap outmaster port it triggers the routeconfig model to teach all the routes to the routetables of all the hubs in the routemap 
8857	1	a	this will in turn cause the calendar model to announce the arrival of day one via the newday inslave port 
8858	1	a	this serves as the termination condition that is conveyed to the scemidispatcher model by signaling the done outmaster port see code for announcearrivalthread below

8869	1	a	this is necessary to reach the condition that the advanceclockthread is waiting for namely for the calendar dcyclestamp data member to change value 
8870	1	a	this is a convenient way for software to keep track of elapsed clock time in the hardware 
8871	1	a	4 1 1 dual ready protocol the message port macros on the hardware side use a general pci like dual ready protocol 
8872	1	a	the waveforms in figure 11 depict several dual ready handshake scenarios 
8873	1	a	a value of one on this signal indicates that the transactor is ready to accept data from the software 
8874	1	a	by asserting this signal the hardware indicates to the software that it has a location into which it can put any data that might arrive on the message input port 
8875	1	a	when a new message arrives as indicated by the transmitready and receiveready both being true that location is consumed see figure 11 on page 46 
8876	1	a	when this happens a notification is sent to the software side that a new empty location is available and this triggers an input ready callback to occur on the software side see section 4 1 2 2 on page 48 
8877	1	a	note that it is possible for transactors not to utilize receiveready and the input ready callback 
8878	1	a	4 1 2 2 input ready propagation if the software client code registers an input ready callback when it first binds to a message input port proxy see section 4 3 3 4 on page 66 
8879	1	a	in other words the software model may have an outer loop that checks the status of an application defined oktosend flag on each iteration and skips the send if the flag is false 
8880	1	a	finally on the 51 st time serviceloop is called the input ready callback is called which sets the oktosend flag in its context after which the outer loop would detect the new flag status and initiate a send on that input channel 
8881	1	a	the handshake waveforms in figure 11 on page 46 are intended purely to illustrate the semantics of the dual ready protocol 
8882	1	a	4 1 3 scemimessageoutport macro the scemimessageoutport macro allows transactors to send messages to the software side 
8883	1	a	a transactor can have any number of scemimessageoutport macro instances 
8884	1	a	see section 4 2 1 on page 59 for details on the meaning of this parameter 
8885	1	a	if in the subsequent cycle the receiveready remains asserted that means that a new empty location is available which the transactor can load any time by asserting transmitready again 
8886	1	a	meanwhile the last message data upon arrival to the software side triggers a receive callback on its message output port proxy see section 4 3 7 1 on page 77 
8887	1	a	this results in a single controlled clock with a ratio of 1 1 a do n t care duty cycle see discussion of duty cycle in section 4 1 4 3 on page 54 and a phase shift of 0 
8888	1	a	4 1 4 1 parameters and signals clocknum 1 this parameter is used to assign a unique number to a clock that is used to differentiate it from other scemiclockport instances 
8889	1	a	dutyhi 0 dutylo 100 phase 0 the duty cycle is expressed with arbitrary integers that are normalized to their sum such that the sum of dutyhi and dutylo represent the number of units for a whole cycle of the clock 
8890	1	a	the default duty cycle shown in the macro wrappers in figure 15 above is a do n t care duty cycle of 0 100 see section 4 1 4 3 on page 54 
8891	1	a	4 1 4 2 deriving clock ratios from frequencies another way of to specify clock ratios is enter them directly as frequencies all normalized to the clock with the highest frequency 
8892	1	a	to specify ratios this way requires the following make each ratio numerator equal to the highest frequency use consistent units for all ratios omit those units and simply state them as integers for example suppose a system has 100mhz 25mhz and 10mhz 7 5 mhz and 32khz clocks 
8893	1	a	to specify the ratios the frequencies can be directly entered as integers using khz as the unit but omitting it 
8894	1	a	 sce mi 53 of 94 formal functional specification 54 100000 7500 100000 32 users who like to think in frequencies rather than ratios can use this simple technique 
8895	1	a	it is also possible that an implementor of the sce mi api may wish to provide a tool to assist in deriving clock ratios from frequencies 
8896	1	a	such a tool could allow a user to enter clock specifications in terms of frequencies and then generate a set of equivalent ratios 
8897	1	a	in addition the tool could post process waveforms such as vcd files generated by the simulation in such a way that the defined clocks appear in the waveform display to be the exact same frequencies given by the user 
8898	1	a	4 1 4 3 do n t care duty cycle the default duty cycle shown in the macro wrappers in figure 15 above is a do n t care duty cycle 
8899	1	a	this is known as a posedge active do n t care duty cycle 
8900	1	a	it is also possible to have a negedge active do n t care duty cycle 
8901	1	a	some implementations may chose to use a reset duration that is larger than the quantify shown above if it is required to achieve proper alignment of multiple cclocks on the edges of the controlled reset as described in section 4 1 4 5 on page 55 
8902	1	a	for example if a software controlled reset is required an application would need to create a reset transactor that responds to a special software originated reset command that arrives on its message input port 
8903	1	a	the scemiclockcontrol macro is the means by which a transactor can control a dut s clock and by which the sce mi infrastructure can indicate to a transactor on which uclock cycles that controlled clock have edges 
8904	1	a	this parameter is used to associate a scemiclockcontrol instance with its counterpart scemiclockport instance that is defined at the top level 
8905	1	a	it can be used to reset the transactor 
8906	1	a	one of the most useful applications of this feature is to perform complex algorithmic operations on the data content of a transaction before presenting it to the dut 
8907	1	a	support for explicit negedge control is needed because without it transactor logic that only cares about controlling posedge clocks could not inadvertently disable the next negedge of a clock when it only intended to disable the next posedge of a clock 
8908	1	a	the transactor can thus sample this signal to know if a dut clock edge occurs 
8909	1	a	this means that any transactor can stop all the clocks in the system by simply de asserting readyforcclock 
8910	1	a	 for a negedge active do n t care duty cycle see 4 1 4 3 on page 54 since the user does not care about the posedge the cclockenabled will always be 0 
8911	1	a	transactors that do not care about negedge control can ignore this signal 
8912	1	a	of 94 functional requirements specification standard co emulation modeling interface sce mi formal functional specification note for a posedge active do n t care duty cycle see 4 1 4 3 on page 54 
8913	1	a	this may involve expanding the interface macros into infrastructure components that are added to the existing structure as well as to generate parameter information that is used to bind the hardware side to the software side 
8914	1	a	it can also be typical for the infrastructure linker to provide options either in the form of switches and or an input configuration file that allow a user to pass along or override implementation specific options 
8915	1	a	specific implementations might require additional parameters 
8916	1	a	it is also possible for a user to specify a do n t care duty cycle 
8917	1	a	the parameter file can be read by the software side of the sce mi infrastructure to facilitate binding operations that occur after software model construction 
8918	1	a	part of initializing the sce mi involves instructing the sce mi to load the parameter file that was generated by the infrastructure linker 
8919	1	a	the information in the parameter file gives the sce mi software side the means to establish rendezvous with the hardware side in response to port binding calls from the user s software models 
8920	1	a	error handling in sce mi was designed to be flexible enough to either use a traditional style of error handling where an error status is returned and checked with each call or a callback based scheme where a registered error handler is called when an error occurs 
8921	1	a	it is up to the application code to check the error status after each call to the api and take appropriate abortive action if an error is detected 
8922	1	a	in this error handler callback approach the user defined code within the handler can initiate abort operations 
8923	1	a	a c application can simply call the abort or exit function after printing out or logging the error information 
8924	1	a	the default error handler attempts to print a message to the console and to a log file and then calls abort 
8925	1	a	a second point to note is that the message text filled out in the error structure is meant to fully describe the nature of the error and can be logged or displayed to the console verbatim by the application error handling code 
8926	1	a	the optional i d field can be used further classify different major error types or even to tag each distinct error message with a unique integer identifier 
8927	1	a	info handling is done with callback functions and a special structure that is used to convey the warning information 
8928	1	a	when any sce mi operation encounters a warning or wishes to issue an informational message the following procedure is followed if an info handler was registered that info handler is called from within the api call that wants to issue the warning 
8929	1	a	in this info handler callback approach the user defined code within the handler can convey the warning to the user in a manner that is appropriate for that application 
8930	1	a	the default error handler can attempt to print a message to the console and or to a log file in an implementation specific format 
8931	1	a	it is important to note that the message text filled out in the error structure is meant to fully describe the nature of the info message and can be logged or displayed to the console verbatim by the application s warning and info handling code 
8932	1	a	an additional category called sceminonfatalerror can be used to log all error conditions leading up to a fatal error 
8933	1	a	this method allows an application to make queries about the version prior to initializing the sce mi that gives it its best chance of specifying a version that it is compatible with 
8934	1	a	with each call the application can pass version numbers corresponding to those it is familiar with and the sce mi can respond with a version handle that is compatible with the queried version 
8935	1	a	if one is found an object of class scemimessageinportproxy is constructed to serve as the proxy interface to that port and the pointer to the constructed object is returned to the caller to serve all future accesses to that port 
8936	1	a	this call signals that it is okay to send a new message to the input port 
8937	1	a	if this pointer is given as a null the sce mi assumes that this port does not need to deploy input ready notification on this particular channel 
8938	1	a	if one is found an object of class scemimessageoutportproxy is constructed to serve as the proxy interface to that port and the handle to the constructed object is returned to the caller to serve all future accesses to that port 
8939	1	a	the application is free to use this pointer for any purposes it wishes 
8940	1	a	68 scemimessageoutportproxy interpret this pointer other than to store it and pass it when calling either the isready or close callbacks 
8941	1	a	it is also inside this call that the sce mi dispatches any input ready or receive callbacks that might be needed 
8942	1	a	if g is non null enter a loop of performing transfers and calling g 
8943	1	a	4 3 3 6 1example of using the g function to return on each call to serviceloop there are several different ways to use the g function 
8944	1	a	some applications might like to force a return from the serviceloop call after processing each message 
8945	1	a	in fact it is possible to force serviceloop to return back to the application once per message by having the g function return a 0 
8946	1	a	an application can use the g function to put serviceloop into a blocking mode rather than its default polling mode 
8947	1	a	69 of 94 formal functional specification 70 to do this the application can define a haveprocessedatleast1message flag as follows 
8948	1	a	the api shall provide a simple accessor to return the number of objects of a given kind and read and write accessors described below to allow reading or overriding attribute values of specific objects 
8949	1	a	these objects and their attributes precisely and fully describe the interfacing requirements between that application and the sce mi infrastructure 
8950	1	a	phase integer phase shift as percentage of duty cycle 
8951	1	a	from the clockbinding objects one can ascertain the number of distinct contributors to the control of a given clock as well as the number of distinct transactors in the system 
8952	1	a	these two accessors read return an integer or string attribute value 
8953	1	a	it is considered an error to pass an unrecognized objectkind name to any of the accessors 
8954	1	a	this provides a convenient way for applications to keep track of elapsed cycles in their respective transactors as the simulation proceeds 
8955	1	a	receive callbacks are registered with an output port proxy when it is first bound to the channel see 4 3 3 5 on page 67 
8956	1	a	proper usage of this callback is to process the data quickly and return as soon as possible 
8957	1	a	the reference to the scemimessagedata is of limited lifetime and ceases to exist once the callback returns and goes out of scope 
8958	1	a	typically in a systemc context the callback might do some minor manipulation to the context object then immediately return and let a suspended thread resume and do the main processing of the received transaction 
8959	1	a	if an error occurs inside the receive callback by implication it is an application error not an sce mi error and thus it is the responsibility of the application to handle the error by perhaps setting a flag in the context object before returning from the callback 
8960	1	a	this can be useful for replacing contexts or receive callback functions some time after the output message port proxy has been established 
8961	1	a	it is possible to implement the c api as functions that wrap calls to methods described in the c api 
8962	1	a	the idea is that to the untimed testbench models the dut itself appears untimed see figure 2 on page 9 when in fact it is a disguised bca model see figure 3 on page 11 
8963	1	a	abstraction gasket a special model that can change the level of abstraction of data flowing from its input to output and vice versa 
8964	1	a	for example an abstraction gasket might convert an untimed transaction to a series of cycle accurate events 
8965	1	a	or it might assemble a series of events into a single message 
8966	1	a	see definition for co modeling co modeling although it has broader meanings outside this document within this document co modeling specifically refers to transaction oriented co modeling in contrast to a broader definition of co modeling that might include event oriented co modeling 
8967	1	a	when performing such operations any transactor can freeze controlled time long enough to complete the operation before allowing clocking of the dut to resume 
8968	1	a	co simulation execution of software models modeled with different levels of abstraction that interact with each other through abstraction gaskets similar to coware s bcash models 
8969	1	a	see section 1 4 on page 3 for meanings of acronyms 
8970	1	a	if the abstraction bridge is the sce mi the job of the dut proxy is to encapsulate the message port proxy interfaces to the message channels in the interface 
8971	1	a	see figure 3 on page 11 for an illustration of dut proxies 
8972	1	a	macros implementation components provided by the hardware emulator vendor to implement the hardware side of the sce mi infrastructure 
8973	1	a	messages are generally not associated with specific clocked events but may trigger or result from many clocks of event activity 
8974	1	a	service loop this is the method that provides a means for a set of software models running on a host workstation to yield access to the sce mi software side so that any pending input or output messages on the channels can be serviced 
8975	1	a	the sce mi infrastructure itself is also considered to have software side and hardware side components 
8976	1	a	the job of a transactor is to decompose an untimed transaction to a series of cycle accurate clocked events or conversely to compose a series of clocked events into a single message 
8977	1	a	when receiving messages transactors have the ability to freeze controlled time long enough to allow message decomposition operations to complete before presenting clocked data to a dut 
8978	1	a	and when sending messages they can freeze controlled time and allow message composition operations to complete before new clocked data is flooded in from a dut 
8979	1	a	uncontrolled clock uclock free running system clock internally generated by the sce mi infrastructure used only within transactor modules to advance states in uncontrolled time 
8980	1	a	it can be used to reset a transactor 
8981	1	a	rather its operation is triggered by arriving messages and can in turn trigger operations in other untimed models by sending messages 
8982	1	a	vhdl scemimacros package the following package can be used to supply sce mi macro component declarations to an application

8984	1	a	one goal of mashbot is to unify the interfaces of a multitude of social networks allowing users to learn a standardized interface and more easily cope with the flood of new social network platforms 
8985	1	a	1 3 glossary campaign a collection of content that is scheduled to be published 
8986	1	a	furthermore with the number of services technologies and specialists arriving each day it is nearly impossible to keep up with all the trends much less fully take advantage of each one or even monitor them all adequately 
8987	1	a	the widespread adoption of communications technology is a double edged sword there are many more avenues for marketing and customer service but it is much more difficult to effectively apply reputation management strategies or adequate customer service through all channels 
8988	1	a	this project proposes to build a tool to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing campaigns and customer service for small to medium businesses 
8989	1	a	however this may expand to include customer service functionality management of more traditional campaigns such as direct mail trade shows and other events or user created campaign classes 
8990	1	a	the first objective is to develop and release a small open source platform to provide a service agnostic facade api bundling common operations in widely used services e g facebook flickr twitter wordpress or youtube 
8991	1	a	furthermore it opens the opportunity for the public to help maintain existing service plugins as well as contribute plugins for new services 
8992	1	a	users will be able to view social networking messages directed at them as well as perform data mining tasks on the social networks to provide more intelligent heuristics regarding brands strength amongst particular markets 
8993	1	a	2 1 1 system interfaces mashbot combines several components to provide required functionality 
8994	1	a	2 1 2 user interface the user interface consists of a web front end with tabs to separate the various workflow areas 
8995	1	a	to create content the user is provided with a calendar scheduling tool and a content editor 
8996	1	a	finally there is an explore view that gives the user a portal with which they can keep tabs on topics of interest in social media 
8997	1	a	4 2 1 4 software interfaces the mashbot software integrates some external software to provide functionality

9013	1	a	a piece of content may take the following forms 0550 
9014	1	a	the system allows the system administrator to configure a timeout after which a user is automatically logged out of mashbot 
9015	1	a	8 4 1 dashboard the dashboard consists of graphs and charts to give the user a quick view on how their campaigns are performing 
9016	1	a	metrics include clickthrough rate page views number of comments service plugins can define additional specialized metrics to track as well for instance retweets for twitter 
9017	1	a	a panel is available to give more information on each metric as it is selected 
9018	1	a	see fig 1 4 1 1 create this view allows users to create campaigns and fill them with content 
9019	1	a	this view is also used when users need to edit an existing campaign 
9020	1	a	see fig 2 add content a user can add content via the add content button near the top of the view 
9021	1	a	this will create a section in the main part of the view that allows the user to add individual elements of that content type each individually scheduled 
9022	1	a	each row line item will allow the user to schedule edit or delete that content type 
9023	1	a	4 1 2 schedule scheduling content users can drag items from the left hand bucket of content to the calendar to schedule content 
9024	1	a	if the user desires a different time he may click the content in the schedule and assign the proper time 
9025	1	a	the user can page from month to month to schedule content to any day desired 
9026	1	a	4 1 3 explore this view allows users to get a pulse on what information social media contains 
9027	1	a	this includes the ability to set up monitored searches for services that support keyword search via api 
9028	1	a	authentication information is retrieved from the database and used to request content from services 
9029	1	a	the software will be used to search multiple web sites for streaming videos and torrents and return these results to the user 
9030	1	a	this document will cover the features of the software and include specifics on what the system will do and any constraints and external factors that might affect the system 
9031	1	a	this section will give a description on hardware and software interfaces that the video searching software requires to perform an action 
9032	1	a	this video searching software will be a system that uses an active internet connection to search multiple websites for streaming videos or torrents 
9033	1	a	the system will be used to aid the user when trying to locate a specific video or genre of video 
9034	1	a	the software aims to help the user by providing a simple interface and a more efficient way of finding the video they require 
9035	1	a	these databases can be easily updated to provide a wider searching range 
9036	1	a	these people would regularly spend periods of time searching websites to try and find the videos they wanted to watch either somewhere to stream the video from or the files to download the video 
9037	1	a	in addition the user will have the option to filter out or only search certain websites for example a user may only want to look at videos on youtube 
9038	1	a	they will have the facility for users to store their favorite videos so that they can come back to the video at another time 
9039	1	a	they will be able to edit which sites the system will search depending on whether they think the site is safe compatible with our software the speed at which the site can be searched and how useful the site is to us i e how many results have come back from that site 
9040	1	a	req 7 there will be page button for the user to navigate the results

9592	1	a	2 1 product perspective duap is a research program to determine how new vii data impacts safety traffic operations and management asset management winter operations and transportation planning 
9593	1	a	the program is focused on demonstration and assessment of data transformation and management and duap system development is a means to that end 
9594	1	a	each representation has its own strengths and limitations but all are intended to create understanding of the system s boundaries components and interactions 
9595	1	a	with well defined interfaces it is possible to improve the functions of the system by adding services that conform to the interfaces but provide new operations 
9596	1	a	services do not unnecessarily constrain the physical and computational hardware to which they might be deployed 
9597	1	a	it is possible to scale the system by adding hardware to support the processing needs of new services as they are developed and deployed 
9598	1	a	maintainability can be preserved by being able to update both hardware and software components while the system is running 
9599	1	a	in the case of the vii poc input service for example data expected to be available would include vehicle location speed direction of travel acceleration brake status wheel angle steering wheel position and headlamp status 
9600	1	a	the michigan intelligent transportation systems mits center atms for example will have its own input service for collecting speed volume and occupancy and may also obtain event descriptions and messages posted on changeable message signs dynamic message signs cms dms 
9601	1	a	the dynamic data services are a caching service intended to store duap data for fast access over a relatively short duration 
9602	1	a	2 2 3 persistent data services persistent data services provide longer term storage within duap of both data collected by input services and metadata needed by duap services to sustain their operations 
9603	1	a	archive services will store data from the dynamic data services to support future data analysis and management needs 
9604	1	a	metadata services manage data needed by other duap services to create a context for the probe vehicle traffic and weather data and describe the operation and formatting of the input computational output and presentation services 
9605	1	a	the purpose of the duap system s computational services is to apply logical algorithms to incoming vehicle and traffic observations in order to transform those observations into data that is directly applicable to transportation management and operations processes

9623	1	a	the intent of adding new data sources is to provide a more complete dataset upon which the transportation agencies can base operational decisions but there are not necessarily any new users of vii data within the agencies 
9624	1	a	oems are in many cases also developing independent telematics networks from which transportation agencies might be able to obtain data similar to that provided through the usdot viic efforts 
9625	1	a	once the vii field infrastructure is in place a network operating entity will be needed to operate monitor and maintain the flow of vii data and the infrastructure enabling it 
9626	1	a	while the usdot vii program is addressing policy issues for the vii network itself mdot will be faced with many of the same issues as it seeks to integrate vii data into its operations

9801	1	a	one problem is no formal or consistent system exists at the district manual or automated to comprehensively track and analyze geographic and temporal trends in permitted and actual water uses within the swuca 
9802	1	a	this is further complicated by the fact that current database management systems and data collection activities were not specifically designed to support these types of activities 
9803	1	a	the result is that the current system does not adequately support the types of analyses required for successful implementation of the swuca management plan 
9804	1	a	the system will be used to track and analyze long term trends in permitted and actual water use and to assist in identifying underlying causes for these trends land use change socio economic conditions environmental factors etc

9814	1	a	the ibm db2 data server was upgraded in january 2003 and it is anticipated that it has sufficient capacity to support the proposed system 
9815	1	a	the wmdb therefore does not provide a comprehensive collection of water quality data 
9816	1	a	unique uids are also assigned to surface water quality sample sites 
9817	1	a	while this transfer is currently only done from the wmdb rdb to the gis it is technically possible to transfer data in the other direction 
9818	1	a	it is assumed that the needed changes to collect and store the data will be made within the current application and database 
9819	1	a	changes to the current architecture requirements could have a negative impact on the development of this system and cause delays in the release of the system

10059	1	a	all beyond project members have been approached and partners themselves have made a selection of appropriate projects that could support the goal of this deliverable 
10060	1	a	therefore the other partners had to find a way to overcome this problem 
10061	1	a	most of the beyond partners planned to have a first prototype at the time of the first milestone after one year of research in the consortium 
10062	1	a	however we opted to let the workpackages take part through projects in application domains in order to obtain a coherent and comprehensive report 
10063	1	a	it is likely that the relationship also extends to future deliverables intended to provide even more detail when we progress towards milestone 2 
10064	1	a	apc apc interactive solutions ag is working on the development of information networks terminals and kiosk solutions to address people s needs for information in public space 
10065	1	a	another focus is to comply with open architecture standards and maintain accessibility of web hosted data 
10066	1	a	results were mostly focused on acceptance of the system in public space and address the design of the solid speech and graphical user interface 
10067	1	a	the monolithic implementation which is used at the moment does not support modelling of upcoming functionality requests and it is very difficult to maintain and extend 
10068	1	a	although the first prototype complies with the specified functionality we have decided to re implement it from scratch and carefully design all application interfaces for process communications 
10069	1	a	better development tools to handle the speech system on an abstract level are required to improve the process of extending its rule database 
10070	1	a	secondly the system needs to have a subtle notion of its services to guide users quickly and effectively 
10071	1	a	they represent input and output channels and provide access to the state of the context itea 99002 beyond beyond public deliverable 8 functional specifications and architecture 10 february 2001 engine 
10072	1	a	multimodality related specifications the terminal is designed to support classical input output channels like typing or reading and complement them with speech and visual capabilities 
10073	1	a	if desired the user can override default settings but because of privacy issues certain output channels are preferred 
10074	1	a	simulation and testing will provide further insight into the integration process and give more practical hints on usability before new features itea 99002 beyond beyond public deliverable 8 functional specifications and architecture 11 february 2001 materialize 
10075	1	a	architectural issues to ensure extensibility of the software system an open architecture has been chosen 
10076	1	a	a first step towards adaptive user interfaces is to have an easy way to create customisable or flexible user interfaces 
10077	1	a	however the process to develop these flexible user interfaces needs to be improved and supported by tools 
10078	1	a	in the computer world authoring tools or rapid application development tools are used to prototype and build the graphical parts of an application 
10079	1	a	an authoring tool for the consumer world can use a similar approach as the user interface development tools in the computer world 
10080	1	a	their experiences resulted in more knowledge needed to specify new requirements 
10081	1	a	the aim of the two prototypes is to give us insight in the feasibility of the development of an authoring tool for user interface development of consumer products 
10082	1	a	this usability testing by expert users in a real project was needed to gain better knowledge on what we expect from an authoring tool 
10083	1	a	although the first prototype offered a limited functionality it gave us the possibility to gain experience on the desired functionality of an authoring tool 
10084	1	a	the authoring tool provides for each project a project repository containing a font definition a colour palette bitmap images and strings 
10085	1	a	the authoring tool allows the user to manage a palette and its colours 
10086	1	a	the authoring tool allows the user to import bitmaps from an external source 
10087	1	a	the authoring tool allows the user to simulate a user interface on a pc 
10088	1	a	from the ui developer s point of view the main need was the addition of the ability to create menus in an osd ui 
10089	1	a	this menu editor allows the user to define items in a menu 
10090	1	a	the authoring tool allows the user to generate c code for a target platform e g a dvd player 
10091	1	a	once the ui satisfies the authoring tool can generate c code for the target platform e g a dvd player 
10092	1	a	simulation related specification as specified in the requirements of section 5 4 1 the first as well as the second prototype allow to make simulations of a user interface on a pc 
10093	1	a	simulations are a way to get early feedback on a ui that is being developed 
10094	1	a	a lot of effort will be done to design the second prototype conform the requirements specified for the second prototype of the authoring tool 
10095	1	a	requirements imposed by vetronics application domain barco and the luc collaborate to realize ruggedized displays for use in several types of vehicles for which the user interfaces can be defined in a flexible way 
10096	1	a	in addition the possibility to add both textual and graphic overlay to the displayed video is necessary to show navigation information diagnostics etc 
10097	1	a	on top of that hardware part we desire to have an intelligent software layer having the most important feature that the user interface is user definable 
10098	1	a	the first prototype of the ui editor was meant to perform some research about the general structure of the editor 
10099	1	a	this prototype gave us an impression of how to implement such kind of program and enabled us to learn about the do s and don ts in this kind of application 
10100	1	a	another important target is to get some feedback of the market about the new concept we are introducing 
10101	1	a	for this aspect we have chosen to add implement a kind of virtual machine which performs the interaction between the ui code and the effective hardware firmware 
10102	1	a	this communication module is also needed to obtain the system configuration from the vector unit 
10103	1	a	so we can add new functionality to support new hardware configurations 
10104	1	a	the prototype consists of a user interface editor a vetronics system and some peripherals to try the complete system as such 
10105	1	a	this expert review resulted in some kind of score by which we could validate the prototype or reject it 
10106	1	a	all functional parts were statically linked to each other without any way to add additional functionality although not without writing lots of code 
10107	1	a	an event driven approach is envisioned in the first prototype to evaluate its feasibility 
10108	1	a	in order to meet this extra requirement a lot of investigation on the architecture of the ui editor has been done and seriously evaluated 
10109	1	a	as a result we are able to add the symbol generator functionality to the editor even with expanded possibilities like macro definition text capability and bitmap operations 
10110	1	a	but this layout is now very static it does not provide the ability to modify the layout e g button layout towards the real application 
10111	1	a	when new hardware is available a lot of additional implementation work has to be done to support the hardware e g can bus usb 
10112	1	a	this is an anomaly when we want to give support updates via the internet 
10113	1	a	the vector system has some agents inside to prioritize the information available ui information system status environment data 
10114	1	a	the ui editor itself enables us to create and modify the user interface off line and then reload it 
10115	1	a	in the definite program we can implement wizards in order to guide the user through several tasks or warn him for contradictory situations 
10116	1	a	in this case we need a kind of user profile and a behavior database in order to take the right decisions predictions 
10117	1	a	although extension will be rather limited in first we want to do some research about extending its implementation in both the firmware and ui editor 
10118	1	a	in vetronics markets probably due to the heavy environmental conditions temperature vibrations noise we can not really use fine multimodal devices 
10119	1	a	also touch input devices are rather frequently used because they do not require additional place 
10120	1	a	we can try the complete system off line on our development computer before loading the generated code into the vector system 
10121	1	a	an important result of the simulation may be the ability to certify the generated ui for use in life critical conditions 
10122	1	a	 we needed to redesign the framework from a static one to a component based one 
10123	1	a	to accomplish this we have chosen to use an component based approach by using the latest sw technologies that are usable within this type of application platform namely com com 
10124	1	a	a mistake occurs when the actions are according to the intended plan but the plan is inadequate to achieve the intended goal 
10125	1	a	an intelligent system that knows the human intentions and the actual and predicted flight status can detect slips from the intended plan 
10126	1	a	to form an internal representation of the flight situation the crew has to integrate all this information presented to them on numerous head down cockpit displays in different formats 
10127	1	a	the flight crew then has to determine the most critical problem and the right procedure to solve it not an easy task for the human being with only a limited view of the situation and it is clear that situations like these contribute considerably to pilot workload 
10128	1	a	it is expected that an intelligent adaptive interface that presents the right information in the right format integrated and intuitive for that particular situation at the right time with an appropriate alerting strategy can significantly increase flight safety 
10129	1	a	even if the flight crew is able to determine a good resolution to solve the problem they have too little overview to optimize it 
10130	1	a	an intelligent flight deck can help the pilot by proposing optimized alternatives out of which the pilot can choose one 
10131	1	a	in such a co operation the pilot and intelligent flight deck share their knowledge and capabilities to improve the safety and efficiency of the overall system 
10132	1	a	in certain time critical high workload situations however it may be necessary or even mandatory to automatically adapt the interface to draw the crew s attention and to allow an immediate but sound response 
10133	1	a	if the automation thinks that for the current situation a different presentation may be more efficient it may suggest an adaptation that has to be agreed upon by the pilot 
10134	1	a	this is in fact self adaptation but allowing the pilot to take the initiative 
10135	1	a	the pilot is then informed if it seems reasonable to tailor the system 
10136	1	a	simple adaptation gives the opportunity to users to tailor the system to their own needs and preferences 
10137	1	a	this already exists in the cockpit of today where the pilots can control the brightness contrast etc 
10138	1	a	proposal for the first prototype the first prototype of the intelligent adaptive flight deck has to assist the pilot in establishing and maintaining situation awareness by presenting the right information in the right format at the right time 
10139	1	a	project status description of the first prototype to observe the environment the first prototype of the intelligent adaptive flight deck consisted of the implementation of two aircraft warning systems the ground proximity warning system gpws and the traffic alert and collision avoidance system tcas 
10140	1	a	they can exchange rough environmental information the detection of hazardous situations and resolution advisories to solve for these critical situations 
10141	1	a	this data exchange allows the system to form one integrated picture of the environment to present alerts in the right order to apply a good alerting strategy and to negotiate resolution advisories so that the resolution of the one critical situation does not induce another critical situation 
10142	1	a	to detect and correct for errors and to help the pilot in his her decision making assistance levels 2 and 3 the warning system adaptation was implemented in particular on the navigation display including the gpws and tcas systems introduced above 
10143	1	a	the range in the nd was automatically adapted to show the pilots the cause s for the warning signals 
10144	1	a	a realistic scenario was developed to test the functionality of the first prototype 
10145	1	a	the participants were first briefed extensively to introduce the intelligent flight deck and explain the scenario 
10146	1	a	after the demonstration the participants were asked to fill out an extensive questionnaire addressing pilot acceptability workload situation awareness and many others 
10147	1	a	for the near future around february 2001 a second group of experts consisting of pilot trainees has been invited to see the demonstration and fill out the questionnaire addressing the first prototype 
10148	1	a	furthermore experts claim the opportunity to overrule the system mental model and in this respect the user interface needs to be altered 
10149	1	a	no efforts are being conducted to generalize the real time simulation software for product simulation purposes 
10150	1	a	in the description the key aspects multimodality adaptivity simulation and usability have been considered as independent variables allowing to show the progress for all workpackages in the project 
10151	1	a	it catches the eye that several projects envisage architectural changes to accomodate the desired extensions 
10152	1	a	it has been mentioned already that in the emergency scenario no subsidy for german partners and no replacement most partners had to tackle the usability issues by themselves 
10153	1	a	in particular at least two projects emphasize that a component based or plug in architecture is envisioned to enhance the flexibility of the final demonstrator 
10154	1	a	the primary goal of this document is to provide a complete and accurate list of requirements for the evla correlator monitor control system 
10155	1	a	 receive configuration information from the evla m c system and translate this info into a physical correlator hardware configuration 
10156	1	a	 process and transfer dynamic control data models filter parameters etc and monitor data auto correlation products state counts etc 
10157	1	a	 monitor correlator and correlator subsystem health and take corrective action autonomously where possible to recover from hardware and computing system faults 
10158	1	a	 perform limited amounts of real time data processing and probing such as providing tools to collect and display auto correlation products

10268	1	a	introduction 1 1 goals and objectives the purpose of this document is to describe requirements for the ne ios child care management nccm software that will serve as a foundation for the final product 
10269	1	a	this document uses written descriptions as well as various types of modeling diagrams to illustrate the high level structure of the application 
10270	1	a	although some of these diagrams may seem to convey similar information they typically do so from an alternate perspective 
10271	1	a	a web based solution will be delivered so that users can access the system with their favorite browser 
10272	1	a	the child care management software is intended to provide a computer based system that will assist in managing a child care center 
10273	1	a	for instance activities like tracking child immunizations and maintaining classroom waiting lists will be performed by the computer system so that employees can spend more time caring for the children 
10274	1	a	administrators are responsible for registering new customers so they are the only employees allowed to view or edit all account information 
10275	1	a	if a parent is unable to pick up their child they may send another person but only if the person had previously been designated as an authorized pick up 
10276	1	a	responsibilities is to document the behavior of children they supervise 
10277	1	a	administrators can access a reporting feature that generates preformatted documents summarizing key customer information 
10278	1	a	in addition to printing these reports administrators are able to print invoices 
10279	1	a	an employee can enter the date of an event as well as a message describing the event 
10280	1	a	low priority requirements may be eliminated if it helps meet the scheduled delivery date 
10281	1	a	r11 med code works after three unsuccessful attempts to enter a password the user shall be locked out of the system until their password is reset 
10282	1	a	name of an authorized pick up r41 high customer the child 
10283	1	a	r47 high customer a waiting list shall store the names and phone numbers of up to 100 potential customers waiting for a classroom opening to enroll their child 
10284	1	a	but the ability of your day care facility to remain in business will be dictated by your ability to manage facility location ability to retain children and establish a plan for growth 
10285	1	a	you will have to manage your facilities in a cost effective efficient manner in order to maximize revenues per class room yet still remain in compliance with federal state and local guidelines 
10286	1	a	can you afford to waste valuable resources convincing parents that staff can responsibly address these issues 
10287	1	a	billing invoices immunizations and other items of concern to parents guardians are all added to allow technology to ease the minds of facility operators allowing them to focus on staff class supervision 
10288	1	a	parents will also have peace of mind knowing that facility operators are able to ensure staff focus is on the children and not the mundane but important bookkeeping aspects of facility management 
10289	1	a	the future of day care in america is bright which means that current day care facility operators will have to plan for the future if they are to benefit from the positive social changes as well as the demographics which favor the expansion of day care and early childhood development 
10290	1	a	code works day care software is leading the way in providing the features necessary to increase enrollment 
10291	1	a	code works also has the expertise to deliver software using various software models that can deliver continued feature upgrades based upon the growth and level of service your facility requires 
10292	1	a	the following are a list of web sites used to compile this document 
10293	1	a	 e g pontis may provide a direct link to gis software for map based querying 
10294	1	a	note that this document is not intended to describe the architecture or data model of pontis 5 0 nor is it intended to describe the specific design or implementation plan for any functional requirement 
10295	1	a	it does not elaborate requirements for the new system in detail although it does identify key stakeholders and stakeholder concerns to be considered in the future pontis version 
10296	1	a	to that end the bridgeware task force has designated the contractor cambridge systematics to undertake a requirements gathering process with guidance and substantive input from a set of bridge management and information systems experts who will serve as a technical advisory group tag 
10297	1	a	this product is intended to replace the existing pontis 4 x product line with a next generation software application utilizing state of the art software development technology 
10298	1	a	the baseline capabilities will be extended to provide licensees the ability to access selected modules from a web browser as well as a dedicated client application depending on the particular bms activity 
10299	1	a	specific goals for pontis 5 0 the goals for pontis 5 0 are to provide the aashto member agencies and licensees with a readily accessible robust repository for bridge information including data inventory condition needs project plans and accomplishments cambridge systematics inc 
10300	1	a	pontis 4 4 and 5 0 address item a and d but assign primary responsibility for b and c to licensing agencies 
10301	1	a	streamlined simpler administration means that agencies will find it easier and faster to install deploy and upgrade the application and manage its operation 
10302	1	a	we explicitly recognize that these priorities and needs may change over time and that the functional requirements and technical design may necessarily adapt to accommodate these changes in priorities and needs 
10303	1	a	 power users who typically would manage an agency s pontis database and or make heavy use of its analytic modeling capabilities routine users such as bridge inspectors or staff data analysts responsible for primary data collection quality reviews and normal data reporting 
10304	1	a	their activities may also include developing field work recommendations and accomplishment verification 
10305	1	a	these users may or may not have an engineering background and are primarily concerned with data review performance measures identification and tracking and summary inventory condition reports 
10306	1	a	the tertiary category of users may make use of pontis but have no vested interest in the product 
10307	1	a	server licenses likely will be needed as well which may mean an expense for licensing agencies 
10308	1	a	pontis 5 0 will maximize the use of third party code libraries whether fee licensed or open source to minimize original development costs to the greatest extent possible 
10309	1	a	pontis 5 0 will take full advantage of web display capabilities including in particular screen real estate management to minimize scrolling paging and tabbing 
10310	1	a	no additional database support is anticipated as of this writing but the design will adhere strictly to ansi sql and odbc jdbc net standards in order to maximize the potential to support additional databases in the future 
10311	1	a	 pontis bridge information will integrate with a more general asset management database structure which may incorporate other types of assets such as sign structures high mast towers walls pavements or buildings 
10312	1	a	7 the reader is invited to review the pontis 4 x user and technical manuals and in particular the glossary of terms as well as the federal nbi coding guide for bridge inspection terminology 
10313	1	a	this further implies that some current pontis 4 4 capabilities may be implemented very differently in a future version in order to take advantage of available commercial and open source code

10396	1	a	note that each alternative assumes that the pontis and virtis opis contractors will coordinate throughout the design of pontis 5 0 and that the virtis opis contractor will be funded outside of the pontis effort to review pontis design documents 
10397	1	a	the cosmic ffp method is designed to work for data rich and real time software and it provides the concepts of software layers and tiers to help differentiate functional user requirements allocated at different levels of functional abstraction 
10398	1	a	this estimate is multiplied by an adjustment factor reflecting application complexity to obtain adjusted cfsu and it may then be scaled as appropriate to yield an estimate in terms of hours or development cost 
10399	1	a	note that the estimates provided below are for the development costs only and do not include the cost of design or testing 
10400	1	a	agencies do not want multiple deployment efforts in order to establish pontis 5 0 in production given costs in hardware training staff time and implementation assistance cambridge systematics inc 
10401	1	a	the effort can be broken down by contract period to accommodate revenue cycles if necessary and 6 
10402	1	a	pontis 4 x will continue to be maintained throughout the development period until all capabilities are delivered and at least 2 interim releases may be needed to address interim functional needs in the user base 
10403	1	a	33 this stable technology assumption was a key factor in the virtis opis decision to focus on a com based approach and it has been proven correct until very recently when net has emerged to replace com 
10404	1	a	agencies can accommodate serial increment releases within their own it planning schedules 3 
10405	1	a	it is generally desirable to show results to the users earlier 4 
10406	1	a	smaller more focused releases may offer additional flexibility and responsiveness to user feedback 6 
10407	1	a	this alternative does emphasize significant prototyping efforts intended to prove out and demonstrate design concepts which serve to communicate key design concepts and shape expectations about the future product 
10408	1	a	this may affect the license base if states decide to develop their own system or move to another system

10618	1	a	it also intends to provide manufacturing economies of scale wherever practical 
10619	1	a	to meet additional functionality and performance requirements this standard is to be supplemented by 
10620	1	a	 i compliance to the list of normative documents is mandatory for all of the gsm services necessary to provide the functionality specified in the eirene frs 
10621	1	a	 i railway networks may implement a short message service centre to be interfaced to the gsm network in order to support railway specific messaging applications 
10622	1	a	 i a railway gsm network is also likely to have external interfaces to i private railway fixed networks public operator networks controller equipment specialised railway systems eg train control systems 
10623	1	a	 i standardised interface protocols are to be provided to allow applications external to eirene to access eirene bearer services 
10624	1	a	 i applications may include i public address intercom driver safety device train borne recorder 
10625	1	a	to meet the specific railway requirements a number of additional features are required some of which have been incorporated in the gsm standard 
10626	1	a	all mobiles are to support these services as defined in the relevant gsm specifications 
10627	1	a	this gsm specification is to be implemented in order to achieve the high performance requirements necessary for emergency group calls 
10628	1	a	it is also necessary to meet different grades of service requirements for different types of communications traffic on the system eg safety eg train control system operational and administrative communications 
10629	1	a	 i a follow me service will be implemented in the eirene network using the gsm unstructured supplementary service data ussd facility to allow users to establish and terminate the forwarding of calls from a functional number to their personal number 
10630	1	a	 i train drivers need to be able to contact controllers and other staff at the push of a single button 
10631	1	a	as a consequence it is necessary to provide a means of addressing calls from a train to certain functions based on the location of the train 
10632	1	a	this may be supplemented with additional information from external systems to provide a greater degree of accuracy 
10633	1	a	 i railway mobiles may support a direct communications mode whereby a mobile can communicate with all other railway mobiles in a local area without the use of gsm infrastructure 
10634	1	a	 i sections 13 to 15 describe the implementation of emergency calls shunting mode and direct mode 
10635	1	a	 i the network services necessary to meet the range of uic requirements are detailed below 
10636	1	a	therefore the alerting duration has to be as short as possible in order to minimize the risk for the party a of missing notification of an incoming call from party c with a higher emlpp priority 
10637	1	a	it is the responsibility of national railways to design their eirene networks to provide the required level of service to eirene compliant mobiles 
10638	1	a	the coverage levels specified above consider a maximum loss of 3 db between antenna and receiver and an additional margin of 3 db for other factors such as ageing 
10639	1	a	 o to avoid the necessity for large cell overlaps to accommodate high speed train operations optimisation of the handover process for such trains is considered necessary 
10640	1	a	 i an additional option is available to reduce the handover break period namely the use of the synchronous handover capability to reduce the break period to about 150ms 
10641	1	a	each authority can decide whether it wishes to use synchronised btss 
10642	1	a	 m note authentication may be delayed if necessary to achieve the required call setup times 
10643	1	a	 i an entitled controller may terminate a vgcs vbs call based on dtmf signalling en 301 515 index 4 5 
10644	1	a	 m in order to minimise the discomfort caused by the dtmf tone added in the voice channel the duration of the tone generated by the fixed line dispatcher shall be 70ms 5ms and there shall be a minimum gap of 65ms between each tone 
10645	1	a	 m to ensure interoperability all eirene mobiles are specified with a common level of basic services facilities and features 
10646	1	a	however where implemented the requirements concerning this interface are mandatory for interoperability o 3 gsm mt eirene applications interface specified to allow an option for separate procurement of gsm mt and eirene application equipment for the cab radio see morane fffis mti

10677	1	a	however these arrangements do not form part of the network numbering plan 
10678	1	a	 i to achieve integration of the eirene numbering plan with the national public numbering plan telephone numbers have to be allocated by the various numbering regulatory bodies on a national basis 
10679	1	a	in addition breakout codes bcs shall be used to allow users within the gsm r network to access external numbers 
10680	1	a	 m national eirene numbers are used to set up calls within a single gsm r network

10682	1	a	 o it shall be possible for authorised subscribers of fixed and mobile networks to call mobiles using the appropriate msisdn number 
10683	1	a	 m the short dialling codes can be defined on a national basis but it is essential that certain codes be used on an international basis in order to achieve interoperability 
10684	1	a	 m standardisation of uic group addresses is required to provide interoperability between the fixed railway networks within the gsm r network 
10685	1	a	 m the group address consists of a service area 5 digits and a function code 3 digits and has a call type 5 see table 9 1 
10686	1	a	 m it is the responsibility of each individual gsm r operator to acquire a public domain ndc from their national telecommunications regulator 
10687	1	a	 i in order to provide a consistent level of service in each railway network and in particular to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming between networks it is important to harmonise subscription details and other information stored in the network 
10688	1	a	in order to provide a consistent international service it is necessary to ensure that priorities are allocated consistently across all railways 
10689	1	a	the following allocation of uic priority levels to emlpp priority codes is mandatory m levels 0 
10690	1	a	 i user access classes are defined in gsm so that under critical conditions part of the user population can be barred from accessing the network in order to avoid congestion 
10691	1	a	 in conjunction with the sim application toolkit en 301 515 index 36 to update sim cards in the home network is recommended see morane sim for more details

10693	1	a	 m each railway is free to implement its own authentication algorithms without any resulting loss in cross border interoperability 
10694	1	a	 i there is a requirement to be able to address communications to a functional number rather than a more permanent subscriber number 
10695	1	a	 i this is an important issue which will affect interoperability and the ability to use public network services 
10696	1	a	there are specific features of individual railways which make it difficult to develop a concise and universally acceptable system within gsm 
10697	1	a	 i to accommodate the different requirements of the individual railways the following approach has been adopted 
10698	1	a	the first is related to passing information to provide an association between a mobile s subscriber number and its functional number 
10699	1	a	 m the use of the forced de registration mechanism without notification to achieve this requirement is acceptable

10707	1	a	7 inform the user whether the registration of the functional number to the user s mobile was successful performed by the mobile 
10708	1	a	 o in the cases described in 11 3 9i and 11 3 9ii national rules may dictate that prior to or instead of performing the sequence described in 11 3 9i steps 1 7 the user shall perform a specified action e g call a dispatcher in the case of drivers 
10709	1	a	 i the sequence described in 11 3 9i steps 1 7 may be interrupted or may require additional user action such as a confirmation 
10710	1	a	 i interconnection of eirene networks is required to allow international call routing 
10711	1	a	call setup between eirene networks using international functional numbers shall be based on the combination of the breakout code bc and international code ic as specified in section 9 
10712	1	a	however it is anticipated that individual national railways may have a requirement for pre defined messages in which case the application will be specified as part of individual national procurements 
10713	1	a	this section describes the handling of high priority voice calls for railway operational emergencies and does not cover public emergency calls ie handling of 112 calls 
10714	1	a	 i railway emergency calls are defined as those calls of railway emergency priority see section 10 which are routed to a pre defined user or group of users due to a railway operational emergency 
10715	1	a	 m it shall be possible to configure railway emergency group call areas to contain combinations of cells controlled by one or more msc s within one or more network s 
10716	1	a	 i for international railway emergency calls in order to minimise call set up times it is recommended that the anchor msc always directly controls the cell where the railway emergency call was originated 
10717	1	a	 i a railway emergency call shall be initiated by using the appropriate function code for the required type of railway emergency call see table 9 8
