Distributed access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
A special case of service observing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
where a science observer is present on site and the client astronomer is remotely connected. is considered here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The requirements speci?c to service observing are: .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The observing program must be automated. requiring little human interaction during the observation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The means that the Gemini software must include a suf?ciently rich pro? gramming environment to make this feasible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This programming environment should be available both to the astronomer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This access may or may not be done concurrently on a shared environment. C .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The programming environment should allow for the communication of special notes. instructions. and comments from the astronomer to the observer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The use of this feature would.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
But interactive observing is perhaps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It will be done on his behalf at a conve? nient moment that is not exactly prede?ned and may be intermixed with programs from other users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification 2 ? 17 GENERAL DESCRIPTION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
OBSERVING SUPPORT Planned Observing Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This might typically be a few times (2) per night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
when sky conditions change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It requires also that the observing program is so well speci?ed that it can be executed by someone else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
For these reasons it can only be applied to the Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been ful?lled and been in operation for a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
which still requires compe? tent monitoring at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or remotely. At the same time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra ?exibility of ground?based astronomy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
So whichever scheme is adopted to perform automatic sequences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
only on error conditions. any time the user is allowed to break a sequence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It will require the use of service and/or remote observing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This can be comple? So?wore Requirements Specification ? August 18, 1994 9:39 om GENERAL DESCRIPTION GENERAL SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS CONTROL INFORMATION FLOW mented by remote monitoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling quickly. exchanging observing programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This can be achieved only with the help of appropriate scheduling software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
which must adVise the operations team on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the various observing programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Thus ?exible scheduling is a superset of queue scheduling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
These requirements apply to the commands and replies between sub?systems (including status information requests and replies).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
information ?ow to and from on?line databases. and commands and software for the IOCs. 0 Requirements A .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The syntax of control ?ow commands is to be consistent across the system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
whether accessing workstation software or IOC software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands to test operational status. inquiries as to version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The support structure for communicating commands must be reliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
