"Currently, telephonic orders are a significant source of business at Gamma-J which is both expensive and labor extensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The organization has to ?gure out a way to have a smooth transition of orders coming in through telephones to the new online ordering system without loosing business to the competitor. 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Gamma-J depends mainly on Fed-Ex for its tracking number and transportation needs to ship the orders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
GOG Software Requirements Specification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This is the Software Requirement Specification for GOG, which describes in detail the objec- tives of the software simulator and the requirements to be considered on its design and con- struction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It will use error models to provide rapid simulations of large amount of data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The realism of the simulations depends on the realism of the available error models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The schema shown in figure 1 depicts from a high level perspective where GOG will produce its data on the overall current data flow for Gaia:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The implementation of the instrumental error models is planned to be a gradual process that will be based on the study of the detailed pixel-level simulated data produced by GIBIS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The simulation of processed data requires models of the calibration errors that will be provided by the CUs in charge of the calibration algorithms development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In order to simulate data at a pre- cise step of the processing, the addition of the calibration errors is planned to be user-selectable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The output format of GOG simulated data will be according to the Interface Control Document for the Gaia Main database (GAIA-C3-SP-ESAC-JH-002 in preparation).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Note that some of the steps and options described here will have to be revised when the actual ICD will be available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
GOG is expected to be in continuous evolution depending on the availability of the error mod- els.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"To allow satisfying all the needs to access specific data, GOG will be entirely modular and configurable through an input configuration file.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"For the source generation, 2 main options will be available:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"1. Generation of the data from the Universe model of the GaiaSimu library: the user will specify a sky region (e.g. an HTM, square, circle).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Note that the relative positions of the sources with each other will not be used by GOG to add overlapping effects, GOG only works source by source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Only the density at the source position could be used to adjust the error models (if they are provided as a function of density).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The user can ask for only one typical epoch data or for all the transits of the source.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Two main types of noises will be simulated: 1. Instrumental noise: noise that will come from the observation process, e.g. on-board detection and tracking or observation dead-time. 2. Reduction noise:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This will depend on the availability of the models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Note that GOG aim will not be to produce raw data but pre-processed data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The following requirements have been capture thinking on a GOG generic operational,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
At this stage some spectations for GOG might changed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The main hurdle GOG has, is that the contents of the main database are not fully completed. For this reason the initial versions of Gog will consider the current specifications and will be based on the restrictions described in section 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
On this overview we see GOG as a unique software product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
From the high level perspective it can be decomposed on the SADT diagram as follows:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"FIGURE 2: GOG general i/o context diagram Exploding the central box, looking one level deeper, we could distinguish the following main blocks of execution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The following pictures shows how the problem is depicted. 2.2 Decomposition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
According to TL-001 a ?Software Product? is composed of several ?Modules?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
In this section we describe how the system is logically decomposed and mention the modules which will appear from Sect. 3 onward and how they interact. GOG as a software product can be decomposed in software modules.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
We have identified the following main conceptual modules,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This is for high level requirements which apply to all modules.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
These requirements may be removed from this document and appear in a higher level requirements document for CU2or at the DPC level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"That is, it will use as other the other simulators the Gaia Simu library and the Gaia Tools library.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
For source generation GOG has 2 main options available: Universe Model from GaiaSimu or a Object Input Catalogue GOG has a source by source processing mechanism GOG must consider noise effects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
For noise generation those effects should be user- selectable (they can be added or not and the values should be given by users).We classify noises in two groups:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
