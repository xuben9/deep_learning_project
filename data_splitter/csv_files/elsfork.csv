PRODUCT CONSTRAINTS 1.1 Purpose of the the Product 1.1.1 Background to the Project Effort The need for a method of visualisation of biological data has been identified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Currently, there are many groups offering many different tools for visualising data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
These visualisation tools provide a range from tabular to three-dimensional graphical views.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"However, a need has been identified for a tool that can display data in a three dimensional environment, which allows the user to investigate the data and easily see various attributes of the data at a glance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"A need for the above-mentioned tool has been identified and, there being no applicable tool available, a project to create such a tool was conceptualised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The primary stakeholder (see 1.2.1) has made the case that the tool to be created is of relevance use and there is a real need for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This need is established through continual use of other similar tools and a continued identification of their shortfalls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
1.1.2 Goals of the Product We want to give the user the ability to visualise and investigate their data in a three dimensional environment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The user should have the ability to see (at a glance) the differences of various selected attributes of their data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The overall goal of this product is to provide the users with something that has previously been unavailable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Matlab can also be used for manipulating the format of the product's required data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? Tomcat/Apache/Ant ? possibly to be used for product deployment 1.4.4 How Long to Develop?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The Grid 3D application was originally developed to be included for a scientific paper to be published at some point in March 2005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"It was, therefore, essential that the application be ready by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The motivation for developing the application within this short time frame was to, firstly, included it in the paper, but also to produce an original product in a constantly advancing genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
1.5 Naming Conventions and Definitions This section shall provide a dictionary containing the meaning of all the name used within this requirements specification document.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? Biological data ? data of a biological scientific nature generated by some product or process (external to the Grid 3D application).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The demonstrator uses the three dimensional view generated by the application to demonstrate one or more properties of the data to any other person.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? Grid 3D ? the application for which this document contains the requirements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"For a detailed representation of the Grid 3D application, please refer to the Design document.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? Identifier ? refers to a user of the Grid 3D application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The identifier use the application to identify different ?points of interest?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"For example, a point that is not close to any other point may be of interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
An identifier may become an investigator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? Investigator ? refers to a user of the Grid 3D application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The investigator uses the application in order to find detailed information about specific points.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
An investigator may originate as an identifier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
1.6 Assumptions This section contains a list of assumptions that are to be made by the developers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? The users have the computing skill for basic operation of one of the operating systems documented in 1.4.3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
See 3.3 for minimum requirements for the work station.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"For a description of any of the below-mentioned names, please refer to 1.5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The context diagram above represents the Grid 3D application during the initialisation stages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It is important to differentiate this with the work context for the application in a state of running.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The following diagram aims to describe the work context for the application when it is being run by the users (identified above).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In the following diagram, the users are grouped as one entity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This is for convenience only and should be thought of as separate entities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"However, the work context applies to each of them in the same manner and, therefore, have been grouped to further the simplicity and understandability of the diagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The purpose of this section is to identify all the business events to which the product responds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This is to identify the logical parts of work that can be used as the basis for discovering the detailed requirements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This section aims to generate some use cases for the Grid 3D application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
These shall be generated from the events list contained in 2.1.2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
It is hoped that use cases can be given that cover all the events listed in 2.1.2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"With this in mind, the use cases will cover more than one event as more than one event can be captured with a single use-case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This section describes the functional requirements for the Grid 3D application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Each functional requirement should have a fit criterion in order to make it possible to test whether the requirement is implemented as specified in the delivered product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? The product shall plot the data points in a scientifically correct manner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? The grid axis should be labelled correctly according to the input from the data file.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? Data points should be coloured in accordance to the cluster number (contained in the data file) ? The product should be able to handle up to 2000 data points.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? A single click of the mouse over a data point should bring up the name of the data point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? A double-click of the mouse over the data point should cause the application to display all the data point's details.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? The product should allow multiple points to clicked so that multiple names can be displayed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? The product should allow the grid to be oriented by the user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Rotation, zoom and move functions should be employed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
2.2.2 Data Requirements The use of the Grid 3D application involves the user supplying a data file.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This data file contains all the information of the points that are to be plotted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This is the attribute that is to be used as the comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? A description for the data point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In order for the grid to reflect the nature of the user's data, the system should allow for the user to specify their own axis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"With this in mind, the first row of the data file should contain the column headings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The following table proposes the format for the data file.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? The axis should be clearly labelled and easily recognised after the grid has been oriented into a different position.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"? The application should be coloured so that the screen shots can be printed out clearly (i.e., black on white background).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? The application should be intuitive and not require any specialist training.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
3.2 Performance Requirements This section aims to specify some of the timing and performance constraints to which the product will aim to adhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? The program should start within 30 seconds ? This depends on the number of data points that are to be plotted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? The interaction with the data points should have a delay of no longer than 2 seconds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? The response to a change in the orientation should be fast enough to avoid interrupting the user's flow of thought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Otherwise known as the Gnome Partition Editor, it is a frontend to the GNU Parted partition editor, and specifically uses its library, libparted, to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables, and perform all the functions it has been designed for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Several optional file system tools provide support for file systems not included in libparted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This document deals with the functions of the 0.6.0?1 version, made available for public testing in 2010?06?19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The software being described in this document has already been developed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The functions and characteristics that will be analysed have already been implemented.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This document has to stay updated with any new features that will be added in future versions of the application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Section 4 discusses the external interface requirements, and finally, in section 5, you can find the nonfunctional requirements of the project.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Each section is divided in subsections where different matters are discussed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"1.4 Project Scope GParted is one of many programs used for creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking and copying partitions, and the file systems on them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing disk space, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
With this you can boot your computer and use the application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"With the .zip file, you can create a bootable USB flash drive, and use that instead of the cd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"It is one of the best among the many of its kind, supporting more file systems and providing more functions than the rest (Clonezilla, Parted Magic, Parted (backend to GParted), Partition Image, Partition Magic for Windows etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
It is written in C++ and is based on the Debian GNU/Linux operating system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"It is a frontend to the GNU Parted application which was written by the GNU team and supports creating, destroying, resizing, checking, and copying partitions, and the file systems on them, but only through command line.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
GParted provides the graphical user interface for ease of access.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Other programs use the Parted libraries as well, like KDE Partition Manager and Pyparted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Because this is a Linux?based application it relies on some other software in order for it to work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This includes but is not limited to:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This is important, documentation and help files are vital to any project?s completeness. 2.4 Operating Environment GParted is developed on x86 based computers using GNU/Linux.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"It can be used on other operating systems, such as Windows or Mac OS X, by booting from media containing GParted Live.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
In other words you will need a Linux operating system for the install version of GParted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The Live version, on which this document is based, needs a basic x86 ?computer, regardless of the operating system, with a CD drive and/or USB port.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In general, it does not consume many resources and almost every computer will be able to handle it properly. 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The program does not support every kind of operation performed in every kind of file system, but it is constantly being updated and more and more actions and file systems will be supported in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"The table of permitted actions in supported file systems is in section 2.2. GParted does not support logical volume management (LVMý) at present, although this feature has been requested by many users and may be implemented in a future release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"It also must be noted that GParted is not to blame, on most occasions, if a specific operation cannot be performed on a specific file system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
It uses a wide variety of third party libraries and tools which perform these operations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"GParted is simply a frontend, which brings together all these underlying functions and processes, and presents them in a graphical and accessible way. GParted requires a working Linux environment for it to work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The Live version requires a working CD/DVD drive for it to boot the computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"As every other Linux application, there is a list of dependencies, or a list of packages required for the program to work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In this occasion, they are file system tools.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"After booting your computer with GParted Live, this is the first screen you see. GParted provides some other modes, other than the first default.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"These include loading to RAM only, safe graphic settings, and failsafe mode. You can also boot your computer?s operating system (if any) and run RAM tests using Memtest86+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Selecting the first option, advances the application forwards and presents us with the next screen. 3.2 Select Keymap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The keymap is the layout of symbols on your keyboard. Different keymaps are supported; this screen gives info about them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Selecting the keymap you want, brings you to the language selection menu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
A list of a wide variety of supported languages is displayed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
You then enter the number that corresponds to the desired language.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"After that, you are presented with a video mode preference menu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The default value you type is 0, which loads the GParted Live application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
On the desktop you can find all the program?s functions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Under that, is a bar which contains the most common functions of the program, which you can perform on the drive (hard disk, USB flash etc.) selected from the drop down menu on the far right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This can be useful if, for example, you plug in a USB flash drive after GParted has booted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Every time you perform an operation, it goes in pending mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Then, you can undo if you regret your choice, or go ahead and click apply for the changes to happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Clear all removes every pending operation from the list.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
You can also undo and apply from the respective buttons on the main functions bar. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
3.8 View Device Information You can view the selected device?s information by clicking View?>Device Information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This brings up information about the selected drive on the left side of the GParted main window. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Details like the device?s model, size, heads, sectors, cylinders etc. are shown. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
A warning is displayed saying that all of your data will be erased.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
3.9 Create Partition Table Clicking on Device?>Create Partition Table lets you create the drive?s partition table?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
So proceed with caution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
A wide variety of partition tables are supported and the default one is ms? dos. ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_table 3.10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Create a New Partition To create a new partition, first select the desired hard disk or other device, from the drop down menu on the right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Then you can either click on New from the main functions bar, or go to Partition?>New.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
A pop up dialog window appears on screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Here you have various options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"First of all, there is a slider which shrinks and moves to either side.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This represents the size and position of the partition you will create.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
