These requirements are not limited to any industry sector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The approach provides a common ?Ianguage? for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This speci?cation does not include the XML schema to be used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ?black boxes?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The following aspects of procurement are out of scope: 0 Seller discovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
0 e-tendering; 0 negotiation of terms and conditions of trade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
0 communication with third parties and intermediaries e.g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"carriers, banks and fiscal authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
0 message transport and security.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
0 data protection and retention rules.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
0 the application of public sector purchasing policy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Such an incremental approach demands that all Documents (those adopted earlier and later) represent the same things in a common way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"These requirements support several Government initiatives, including.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The greatest bene?ts accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re-keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"One example is the ?three-way match? between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer?s back office.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Cross?Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This specification provides a clear ?stake in the ground? for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple specifications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Aworking group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"These requirements have been re?ned through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The method used is based on the OeE?s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF); see www.qovtalk.qov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.asp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The scope for this speci?cation is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
