"Currently, only a conceptual diagram eXists for the system and should be Viewed as such (see Figure 1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The BE Management functions Will run on one of the cluster processors With one or more shadow processors standing by.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The remaining processors Will be running the Data Processing functions. Correlator lag data Will be received directly from the Correlator Baseline Boards in the form of Lag Frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The lag frames contain correlation lag values and all auxiliary parameters needed to assemble the lags into complete lag sets (properly ordered time series).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It is currently assumed that all observational modes yielding correlator results that are transmitted to the Backend Will be in the form of lag frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The BE Will receive and act upon status requests and control commands originating in or Via the M&C System. Data Processing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The Correlator lag frames Will be assembled into time series, normalized, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
When necessary time stamp adj usted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The time series Will also be Fourier Transformed and other user selectable time and/or frequency domain processes Will be applied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Prior to output, the end results Will be formatted to meet the internal needs of the e2e. Data Output Formatted spectra Will be transferred to the End-to-End System.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
All pertinent meta?data Will be contained in the formatted output.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The fundamental unit of output is the minimum sub-band cross- power spectrum produced by the Correlator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
(No ?stitching? operations that combine spectra from different sub-bands Will be performed.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The BE Will produce a variety of error, warning, status and other reports and messages that Will be transferred to the M&C for ?nal disposition. 2.2.4 Monitoring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The ability to attempt recovery from failure and out of spec performance conditions Will be built into the system. 2.2.6 Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"The system Will provide control and auxiliary parameters to input, output, processing, monitor, recovery, and other functions and receive status and performance data from them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The ability of the Backend System to achieve and maintain real-time processing Will be Vitally dependent upon reliable operation and rapid diagnosis and repair of faults in the hardware and software systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
These individuals Will be responsible for performing corrective and preventive maintenance along With periodic performance tests and upgrades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Engineers and technicians Will need tools to inspect individual devices from remote locations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
These individuals are primarily interested in the science that is obtained from the instrument.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Their main interaction Will be to select and provide parameters for any additional data processing beyond the Fourier transforms. Software Developer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
These individuals are responsible for developing the software and Will interact With the system to ensure that it is functioning properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The software developer requires remote access to the system so that troubleshooting can be accomplished away from the EVLA and during non-Working hours. Web User,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
A few authorized individuals may be allowed access to parts of the system that are usually considered restricted. The Correlator Backend System is a critical component in the Astronomical data path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"If it is unavailable, incoming astronomical data Will be lost. Computer Hardware Limitations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Processing Limitations Operations performed shall be reversible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"That is, the original raw uncorrected data must be recoverable from the processing output.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It is assumed that the Correlator Will deliver suitably formatted network data packets to the input network of the Backend System.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Lag frames Will not necessarily arrive in Lag Set order.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
All lag frames for the same baseline Will be directed to the same Backend processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It is further assumed that the number of lags per Lag Set Will always be a power of two. 2.5.2 Auxiliary Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
It is assumed that all auxiliary data needed for processing and formatting operations Will be provided directly by the correlator or indirectly by the Monitor and Control System in a timely manner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
It is assumed that the e2e System Will be capable of accepting output data rates and volumes generated by the Backend System.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Visibility data from different baselines could be processed by different BE processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Final assembly of all Visibility data is expected to be performed by the e2e system. Description Lag Frames 7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The BE shall receive LT A or SpeedDump Lag F rames ?om the C or'relator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"For a detailed description of the two dump formats see Reference 8, pages 69 to 71.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This Will most likely be in the form of one or more frames per UDP/IP packet 3.1.1.2 Transfers 7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
