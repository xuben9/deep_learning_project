The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"These defaults should include: 7 0 user?de?nable values; 0 values same as previous item; 0 values derived from context, e.g.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Where the System employs a graphical user interface, it must allow users to customise it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Customisation should include, but need not be limited to the following changes: Usability 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The user interfaces should be designed to make them user?intuitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
ICT accessibility: ISO 9241?20 shall be the standard for guidance on ICT accessibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and recommendations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
User interfaces should meet its requirements and recommendations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Content accessibility WCAG 1.0 shall be the standard used for guidance on content accessibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
General guidance on achieving self?descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241?110.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Offering altemative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a speci?c unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop?up windows should only be opened if this supports the user?s task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
They could make it cognitively more dif?cult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, ?elds and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable Via a keyboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be suf?cient so as not to impede readability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Distinguishable within?page links: Within?page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Within?page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines 24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Using appropriate terminology speci?c to the user?s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or pop?up windows should be clearly marked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
space ?lled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the Visual skimming of the page.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Color should never be the only means of coding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Providing altematives to frame?based presentation: If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in ?nding similar information at the same position on different pages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The Intemational Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241?14 to ISO 9241?17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"ISO 9241?14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241?15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241?16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241?17 about forms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915?1 to ISO 14915?3 should be taken into account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be 41' placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the 44' user when individualization and/ or adaptation are used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Making user pro?les evident: If prede?ned user pro?les or user?speci?ed pro?les 45 are used for individualizing or adapting content, the pro?le currently used should ' be made evident.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"If pro?les are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"46 Allowing users to see and change pro?les: If user?speci?ed pro?les are used, users ' should be able to see, modify and delete that pro?le on demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed per 3' .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
4 The number of incidents of unplanned downtime for the System must not exceed ' per .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"5 In the event of any software or hardware failure, it must be possible to restore the System (with inline synchronization) within no more than hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In this context, performing a search means returning a result list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It does not include retrieving the records themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The System must be able to retrieve and display within 5?8 seconds the case which has been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or 3. number of cases in the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This requirement is intended to allow for rapid retrieval of frequently?used cases, on the understanding that frequency of use is typically correlated with recent use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The System be scaleable and must not have any features which would preclude use in small or large police stations, with varying numbers of cases handled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The proposed functional architecture is modeled around centralized deployment to facilitate ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in open standards and web technologies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The 3 C?s (Core?Con?guration?Customization) forms the guiding principle for the architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the ?gure below.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Each of the components contains multiple services as de?ned by Service De?nition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as standard components with necessary con?guration changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The customization layer can override and add to the core services based on the speci?c state requirements and can be plugged with the core services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The deployment of the application will be at state level and will be con?gured and customized as per the state speci?c extensions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Central trading System.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The central trading system (CTS) is to complete the trading of stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It analyses the instructions that enter the central trading system and diVides them into several kinds of instructions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The system will make a match between them under specifical prescripts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Also, the central trading system provides some interfaces to send messages to other modules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The CTS is just a subsystem of the whole stock trading system (STS) system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"There are mainly siX subsystems involved, stock account operation, ?nancing account operation, trade client serve, network message promulgating, central trading system and trading system manage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Communications exist among these subsystems which complicates the relationships between subsystems. The CTS receive instructions from trade client serve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Then the CTS produces new messages which to be sent to network message promulgating after dealing with the instructions from trade client serve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Also, the system manager is authorized to access the information in CTS. There are mainly two kinds of users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The CTS provides the terminal users easy Operations that are con?ned to a series of mouse clicks and keyboard, which compared to other systems are really much simpli?ed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"However, for another user, things are different .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
the maintainers of this CTS must be familiar with java programming and the socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"When the system crashes down, they can find the cause and ?x it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"When new requirements should be supported, they can modify the program to make it ?t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"As the instruction is frequently operated in CTS such as fetch, deal with, repeal and so on, the CTS is heavily transferred.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The program must take this into consideration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The maintainers of CTS should have good strategies to overcome crash of the system when overhead exceeds the capacity of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"There are mainly five kinds of actors, which here consist of other related sub-systerns, involved with our Central Trading System.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Often, user-scenario is considered the same to use-case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
They both can help our team understand how system functions and features will be used by different classes of end-users (actors).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"However, I prefer to understand it like this: a user scenario is a particular environment within a specified use case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"So, I will specify user-scenarios going along with developing use cases in the next session. Preconditions . . 1nformat10n Trigger",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
