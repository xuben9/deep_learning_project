"short delivery, damaged goods, underperformance of service etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Proposed Remedy is the Buyer?s suggested solution to the variance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This may be in response to a Receipt Advice that contains variance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"For example, the Seller may instruct the Buyer to return the goods, await collection of the goods (by the Seller or his carrier) or destroy the goods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Rectification Advice is the Buyer?s cost code reference (in cases where this has actually been communicated to the Seller).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

XML extensible Markup Language.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
These requirements are not limited to any industry sector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The approach provides a common ?Ianguage? for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This speci?cation does not include the XML schema to be used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ?black boxes?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"carriers, banks and fiscal authorities; - message transport and security; - data protection and retention rules; - the application of public sector purchasing policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
eProcurement is a many-to-many electronic data interchange (EDI) problem on a large scale and requires both the sender and the receiver to interpret each and every data element in precisely the same way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Such an incremental approach demands that all Documents (those adopted earlier and later) represent the same things in a common way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"0 Note: for a revision, the whole Document may need to be re-issued and manual intervention may be required; ?cancellation? o cancellation of original Document in its entirety.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"1.2 Benefits These requirements support several Government initiatives, including: .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The greatest benefits accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re- keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"One example is the ?three-way match? between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer?s back of?ce.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Cross-Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium- sized enterprises (SMEs).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This speci?cation provides a clear ?stake in the ground? for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple speci?cations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"A working group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"These requirements have been re?ned through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The method used is based on the OeE?s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF); see www.qovtalk.gov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.as|o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with UML.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"- classes are colour coded for convenience, with colours indicating the parent Package of each class: 0 Party pink 0 Document cyan 0 Line green 0 Item purple.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
chapter 3 of this specification covers common classes which are re-used in more than one Document.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
- chapter 4 covers individual Document speci?cations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"For this reason, each Document specification description contains only descriptions of the attributes that are specific to that Document.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"All other elements are optional, although some may be required to support certain business processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The scope for this specification is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

"Every Document has a sender and receiver, one of which is a Buyer role, the other a Seller role.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The Party types, ro|es names and Documents sent and received are shown in Table 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The Purchasing Manager is not involved in other transactions; if the Purchasing Manager requests or makes a purchase, that individual adopts the role of Originator or Order Point respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Originator also known as requisitioner, has the original demand for each Item of goods and/or services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"If Originator subsequently places a Purchase Order, the Originator adopts the role of Order Point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Order Point raises Purchase Order.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Universally Unique Identi?er (UUID) is an instance identifier generated on the fly as speci?ed in ISO 11587.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It is also known as a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
UUID is a 128 bit string usua||y formatted as 32 characters alphanumeric.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
In this speci?cation UUID is used for matching instances of Document and Line between Documents and for referring to multiple ro|e instances of the same Party within a single Document.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"UUIDs provide an effective means to ensure exact matching of identi?ers at machine level, but are not well suited to visual matching, which is why existing ID data are also required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Each Document is made up of a common set of elements, which are described below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The descriptions are illustrated with UML class diagrams.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
A specialisation inherits all of the properties of its parent class.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Some knowledge of UML is needed to understand the model fully, but the text is intended to be understandable to those who are not familiar with the UML notation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
A sender and a receiver are included in every Document.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
