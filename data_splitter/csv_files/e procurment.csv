The MMF launched a project to establish an electronic money market environment in South Africa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"UNEXcor and STRATE tendered for the dematerialisation and settlement of money market instruments and in September 2002, the MMF appointed UNEXcor as the service provider.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Pursuant to the appointment of UNEXcor as the service provider of the dematerialisation and settlement of money market instruments an agreement to merge STRATE and UNEXcor has been reached effective from 01 August 2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The new entity, hereinafter referred to as STRATE, will provide the services as originally tendered by UNEXcor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The JSE is a paid-up member of the Association of National Numbering Agents (ANNA), i.e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
an authorised National Numbering Agent (NNA) - an entity authorised to issue ISINs in accordance with ISO and ANNA rules and guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In terms of the requirements of ANNA, only one NNA may be authorised per country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The JSE issues and disseminates ISINs for equities when a new equity is loaded in the mainframe programme - EQUITY MASTER DATA (EMD).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
All equity master data is managed and maintained by the JSE's Listings Division.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The JSE's Market Information Division also maintains and issues ISINs for bonds, as a service to BESA, in the mainframe programme GILT MASTER DATA (MDGL), which is a manual process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The scope of this project is to provide an electronic method to enable the MMF participants via STRATE to create, amend and delete ISIN codes for money market instruments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This document sets out the business requirements for the issuing of money market instruments ISIN codes by the JSE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The costs will be forwarded to STRATE for their review and approval and only thereafter, subject to NMPG approval of the SWIFT messages to be used and message content, will design and development start taking place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"(Note: -Due to unforeseen complications, the design and development has been completed prior to the costs being approved by STRATE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
5. Business Requirements 5.1 Current Business Environment Money market instruments are normally traded and settled on the same business day (T+0).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Settlement is on a gross physical basis between seller and buyer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The majority of activity in the money market is undertaken in the primary market (i.e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
between issuer and buyer) and the typical participants in this market are registered banks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The Objectives of the Electronic Money Market are as follows: - ? Reduce the identified risks associated with Money Market practices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? Improve liquidity in the Money Market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? Improve the tradability of the instruments in the secondary market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? Reduce the inherent costs in Money Market processes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"? Improve the marketability of instruments, creating a competitive benefit for an institution trading in Money Market instruments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
? Align South African market practices and procedures with world best practices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"? Improve the integrity of the Money Market creating an environment that is safe, secure, structured, formalised and robust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
The MMF estimates an issuance requirement of approximately 200 to 500 ISINs per day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
To distinguish money market instruments ISINs from equities (ZAE) and bonds (ZAG) the MMF has requested the use of an ISIN prefix of ZAM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The automated ISIN Issuance for Money Market Instruments system will be implemented by the JSE in the 2nd quarter 2004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The following assumptions have been made: ? The Custodian and Banker components are incorporated into one entity - CSDP.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
? The Trading component refers to either a system (Trading or Reporting Engine) or the act of reaching a contractual agreement (i.e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The JSE?s ASD department will be required to develop a programme for the automatic issuance of ISINs for money market instruments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This will include a programme to ""unstring"" the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages and ?string? the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages, as detailed in Appendix B to K, for the request and notification of ISINs by/to STRATE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
To differentiate between the JSEs current SWIFT BIC codes and ensure correct routing and message identification the JSE will apply for a new branch code ?ISN? as an extension of their current BIC address.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
5.3.3 Service Level Agreement The JSE and STRATE will enter into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that sets out all the arrangements pertaining to the service provided by the JSE and will include a Business Continuity Plan(BCP).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This will be made available to money market participants for their perusal and reference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Category 2: Yield based, fixed coupon rate and fixed term, where the MMI is bought at nominal value, the coupon is payable at intervals (i.e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Coupon Interval) throughout the term, and the final coupon payment and the nominal value are repayable on maturity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Category 3: Yield based, variable coupon rate and fixed term where the MMI is bought at nominal value, coupon is payable at intervals (i.e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Coupon Interval) throughout the term, and the final coupon payment and the nominal value are repayable on maturity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Category 4: Yield based, variable coupon rate and variable term where the MMI is bought at nominal value, coupon is payable at intervals (i.e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Coupon Interval) throughout the term, the nominal value and coupon for the last interest period are repayable on maturity and the instrument matures on call.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
These generic characteristics together with the approved the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages formats and contents will determine the fields required in the Money Market ISIN Issuance programme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The table below sets out per generic money market instrument: - ? The data required to be held per MMI by the NNA; and ? The definitive characteristics (i.e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
the unique combination of characteristics) required for the issuance of ISINs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
:- Data Required Definitive Characteristics for ISIN Generation per Generic Category Message Type Message Initiator Message Recipients Details.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
1 Request New STRATE JSE Request for issuance of new ISIN.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
2 Reject New JSE STRATE Reject request ? duplication (DUPL) or invalid2/incomplete (INVL) request.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
3 Accept New JSE STRATE Accept request for new ISIN and include ISIN in message.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
4 Request Cancellation STRATE JSE Request for cancellation of existing ISIN.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
