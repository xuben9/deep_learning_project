So we must be able to support this wide (and growing) range of interfacing capabilities of our Vetronics hardware in our UI-Editor as kind of PIug-Ins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This will also solve our maintainability issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Adaptivity related specifications The generated User Interface is only off-Iine adaptive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Which means the UI is modified on a separate computer and then reloaded into the Vector System.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The Vector system has some agents inside to prioritize the information available (UI- information, system status, Environment data, ...).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Though using off-Iine adaptivity, the running Vetronics application (based on code realized by means of the UI Editor) can demonstrate ?intelligent? behavior to some extent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The User Interface has access to its own data (directly UI-related), but also to data provided by the firmware concerning the current system status and its environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"As a consequence, there is a need for a kind of decision algorithm (=agent) in order to decide whether the UI is more important than the system/environment data or vice-versa, depending on the actual content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This will re?ect in the information the user gets to see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
It is possible that in dangerous conditions the environmental data force the defined UI to be overruled by some buiIt-in UI elements (e.g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The UI-Editor itself enables us to create and modify the User Interface off-Iine and then reload it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
In the definite program we can implement wizards in orderto guide the user through several tasks or warn him for contradictory situations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
These self- Iearning wizards will recognize the user?s behavior and identify occasions to interfere and help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In this case, we need a kind of user pro?le and a behavior database in order to take the right decisions/predictions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In this context, we will use the reference model in which we collaborated with the other members of WP2 for the Deliverable 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This reference model will be used in the agent approach of both the ?rmware and editor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Although extension will be rather limited in ?rst, we want to do some research about extending its implementation in both the Firmware and UI-Editor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Multimodality related specifications The relation of this project to multimodality is rather limited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"However, our Vector system should be able to communicate with all kinds of peripherals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In Vetronics markets, probably due to the heavy environmental conditions (temperature, vibrations, noise, ...) we cannot really use fine multimodal devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"However, auditive information is one of the most used feedback methods in train applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Also Touch Input devices are rather frequently used because they do not require additional place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Currently, support for a touch screen is provided in the UI-Editor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"As a consequence, the Vector system does not have to be available while developing and testing the UI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This is a very important demand because the systems are mostly built in into consoles where they are not easily accessible for downloading etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
An important result of the simulation may be the ability to certify the generated UI for use in life critical conditions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This can be achieved when using an identical Virtual Machine in both the simulator and firmware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This is to be investigated after the finalization of our application and is certainly beyond the context of this BEYOND project.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Architectural issues Because this new approach demands flexible functionality by using PIug-Ins, we needed to redesign the framework from a static one to a component based one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
In order to be sure we can cover all flexibility requirements a lot of effort is now being done in the complete architectural redesign of the UI-Editor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
This architecture is thus considered as a very open framework (the base application) where we can easily plug in all PIug-Ins we need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"To accomplish this, we have chosen to use an component based approach by using the latest SW?technologies that are usable within this type of application/platform, namely COM & COM+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Accident analysis has shown that 65% of all aircraft incidents are caused by human error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Two kinds of human errors can be distinguished: slips and mistakes [Reason, 1987].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"A slip occurs when the intention is right, but a deviation of that intention occurs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"A mistake occurs when the actions are according to the intended plan, but the plan is inadequate to achieve the intended goal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
It is expected that slips and mistakes in aircraft operation can be avoided by an intelligent adaptive flight deck that assists the ?ight crew in performing theirtasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
An intelligent system that knows the human intentions and the actual and predicted flight status can detect slips from the intended plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Ifthe system is aware of the goals of the operation, the intelligent system can even give a recommendation to the pilot to correct for the error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In most cases, mistakes are not simply due to a bad knowledge of the theory or procedure, but are rather a logical consequence of a lack of situation awareness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"The flight deck communicates to the pilot information about the ?ight status (flight plan, position, velocity, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"To form an internal representation of the flight situation, the crew has to integrate all this information presented to them on numerous head-down cockpit displays in different formats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In addition, the auditory channel is used to present advice, warnings and alerts to the crew.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"Especially during critical situations, where the situation awareness is of greatest importance, pilots have difficulties building up a representation of the ?ight situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"At the same time, several buttons can lighten up, various alerts can be given, and information is highlighted on the display.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Mistakes can be prevented by assisting the pilot in building situation awareness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Another contributorto the high workload during critical situations in the cockpit is the task ofdecision making.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Even if the flight crew is able to determine a good resolution to solve the problem, they have too little overview to optimize it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
An intelligent ?ight deck can help the pilot by proposing optimized alternatives out of which the pilot can choose one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In such a co-operation, the pilot and intelligent ?ight deck share their knowledge and capabilities to improve the safety and efficiency of the overall system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

"Levels of the adaptation process Four stages can be distinguished in the adaptation process: initiation, proposal, decision, and execution [Dieterich et al., 1993].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The agents performing or controlling these stages are the pilot of the automation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
This adaptation is contradicting with the human-centered design philosophy and seems therefore unacceptable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"In certain time-critical, high workload situations, however, it may be necessary or even mandatory to automatically adapt the interface to draw the crew?s attention and to allow an immediate but sound response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"Because the adaptation is unexpected and may cause confusion, its occurrence must be well known and trained by the cockpit crew.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"User?controlled self-adaptation: the decision to adapt is taken by the user, while all other tasks are automated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"If the automation thinks that for the current situation a different presentation may be more ef?cient, it may suggest an adaptation that has to be agreed upon by the pilot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
" User?initiated self-adaptation: the user takes the initiative, the automation proposes, decides and executes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
"This is in fact self-adaptation, but allowing the pilot to take the initiative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
" Computer?aided adaptation: on a user?s initiative, the automation proposes an adaptation, which it will execute afterthe user?s approval.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
" Svstem-initiated adaptation: on a system?s initiative, the user proposes, decides and executes the adaptation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The pilot is then informed if it seems reasonable to tailor the system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
Adagtation: the user performs the tasks on all stages of the adaptation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
The management of [company name]. has identified a potential need for re-writing its core Laboratory Information System (LIS) to improve the performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
"In general, this project will provide a stable environment, automate decisions, streamline work?ows, and employ industry standard coding and documentation practices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
All functionalities for the new [system name] system would be documented in this FRS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
