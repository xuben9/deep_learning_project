Inventory Management users should be able to view all past and current acquisitions. Receiving Associates use this function to locate an expected acquisition when receiving a donation at the loading dock.,0;;;
Pickup and Decon crews may also use this function to initiate the process of receiving items while in the truck, on their way to the receiving dock.,1;;;
Off acquisitions are not typically pre-scheduled as Pick Up and Decon acquisitions except for those submitted through the organizational website.,0;;;
Administrator Director Manager Customer Service Representative,0;;;

9. The system should provide a link from the acquisitions view in the Inventory Management System to the acquisition creation screen in CRM for easy access.,0;;;
10. Inventory Management users should be granted permission to create new Drop,1;;;
Off acquisitions in CRM in order to access that functionality.,1;;;
A donor in possession of a valid acquisition number can proceed to the receiving dock where the items to be donated will be received and processed, and a donation receipt will be generated.,0;;;
Alternatively, a donor may go directly to the receiving dock, in which case a new acquisition is created by the Receiving Associate before items can be received and processed.,1;;;
The screens used for the acquisition process should simplify and expedite the data entry process, allowing the Receiving Associate to enter only the information needed to generate the donation receipt.,1;;;
Additional attributes needed to complete the item information and effectively add the item to the inventory can be added at a second step, after the receipt has been printed and the donor has been served.,1;;;
The Receiving Associate can print temporary acquisition labels for items that require further processing.,1;;;
Pick Up and Decon crews may also initiate the receiving process, entering as much detailed information about the donated items as desired, and generating a donation receipt.,0;;;
They cannot, however, add items to the inventory or complete the acquisition process.,1;;;
A Receiving Associate is required to review all the acquisition information before those actions can take place.,0;;;
1. Donor or Primary Contact arrives at receiving dock with a valid donation number 2.,0;;;
Receiving Associate locates donation request in the system (see View Acquisitions),1;;;
3. System displays donation request information,1;;;
4. Receiving Associate enters information about each donated item into the donation request (see Add Item to Inventory) 4.1.,1;;;

The MMF launched a project to establish an electronic money market environment in South Africa.,0;;;
UNEXcor and STRATE tendered for the dematerialisation and settlement of money market instruments and in September 2002, the MMF appointed UNEXcor as the service provider.,0;;;
Pursuant to the appointment of UNEXcor as the service provider of the dematerialisation and settlement of money market instruments an agreement to merge STRATE and UNEXcor has been reached effective from 01 August 2003.,0;;;
The new entity, hereinafter referred to as STRATE, will provide the services as originally tendered by UNEXcor.,0;;;
The JSE is a paid-up member of the Association of National Numbering Agents (ANNA), i.e.,0;;;
an authorised National Numbering Agent (NNA) - an entity authorised to issue ISINs in accordance with ISO and ANNA rules and guidelines.,0;;;
In terms of the requirements of ANNA, only one NNA may be authorised per country.,0;;;
The JSE issues and disseminates ISINs for equities when a new equity is loaded in the mainframe programme - EQUITY MASTER DATA (EMD).,0;;;
All equity master data is managed and maintained by the JSE's Listings Division.,0;;;
The JSE's Market Information Division also maintains and issues ISINs for bonds, as a service to BESA, in the mainframe programme GILT MASTER DATA (MDGL), which is a manual process.,0;;;
The scope of this project is to provide an electronic method to enable the MMF participants via STRATE to create, amend and delete ISIN codes for money market instruments.,0;;;
This document sets out the business requirements for the issuing of money market instruments ISIN codes by the JSE.,0;;;
The costs will be forwarded to STRATE for their review and approval and only thereafter, subject to NMPG approval of the SWIFT messages to be used and message content, will design and development start taking place.,0;;;
(Note: -Due to unforeseen complications, the design and development has been completed prior to the costs being approved by STRATE.,0;;;
5. Business Requirements 5.1 Current Business Environment Money market instruments are normally traded and settled on the same business day (T+0).,0;;;
Settlement is on a gross physical basis between seller and buyer.,0;;;
The majority of activity in the money market is undertaken in the primary market (i.e.,1;;;
between issuer and buyer) and the typical participants in this market are registered banks.,0;;;
The Objectives of the Electronic Money Market are as follows: - ? Reduce the identified risks associated with Money Market practices.,0;;;
? Improve liquidity in the Money Market.,0;;;
? Improve the tradability of the instruments in the secondary market.,1;;;
? Reduce the inherent costs in Money Market processes.,1;;;
? Improve the marketability of instruments, creating a competitive benefit for an institution trading in Money Market instruments.,1;;;
? Align South African market practices and procedures with world best practices.,1;;;
? Improve the integrity of the Money Market creating an environment that is safe, secure, structured, formalised and robust.,1;;;
The MMF estimates an issuance requirement of approximately 200 to 500 ISINs per day.,1;;;
To distinguish money market instruments ISINs from equities (ZAE) and bonds (ZAG) the MMF has requested the use of an ISIN prefix of ZAM.,0;;;
The automated ISIN Issuance for Money Market Instruments system will be implemented by the JSE in the 2nd quarter 2004.,0;;;
The following assumptions have been made: ? The Custodian and Banker components are incorporated into one entity - CSDP.,0;;;
? The Trading component refers to either a system (Trading or Reporting Engine) or the act of reaching a contractual agreement (i.e.,0;;;
The JSE?s ASD department will be required to develop a programme for the automatic issuance of ISINs for money market instruments.,0;;;
"This will include a programme to ""unstring"" the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages and ?string? the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages, as detailed in Appendix B to K, for the request and notification of ISINs by/to STRATE.,0";;;
To differentiate between the JSEs current SWIFT BIC codes and ensure correct routing and message identification the JSE will apply for a new branch code ?ISN? as an extension of their current BIC address.,1;;;
5.3.3 Service Level Agreement The JSE and STRATE will enter into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that sets out all the arrangements pertaining to the service provided by the JSE and will include a Business Continuity Plan(BCP).,1;;;
This will be made available to money market participants for their perusal and reference.,0;;;
Category 2: Yield based, fixed coupon rate and fixed term, where the MMI is bought at nominal value, the coupon is payable at intervals (i.e.,0;;;
Coupon Interval) throughout the term, and the final coupon payment and the nominal value are repayable on maturity.,1;;;
Category 3: Yield based, variable coupon rate and fixed term where the MMI is bought at nominal value, coupon is payable at intervals (i.e.,1;;;
Coupon Interval) throughout the term, and the final coupon payment and the nominal value are repayable on maturity.,0;;;
Category 4: Yield based, variable coupon rate and variable term where the MMI is bought at nominal value, coupon is payable at intervals (i.e.,1;;;
Coupon Interval) throughout the term, the nominal value and coupon for the last interest period are repayable on maturity and the instrument matures on call.,0;;;
These generic characteristics together with the approved the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages formats and contents will determine the fields required in the Money Market ISIN Issuance programme.,0;;;
The table below sets out per generic money market instrument: - ? The data required to be held per MMI by the NNA; and ? The definitive characteristics (i.e.,0;;
the unique combination of characteristics) required for the issuance of ISINs.,0;;;

Refer Appendix A for the process flows of the above messages.,1;;;
Refer Appendix B to K for fields and contents of the MT 598 User Defined SWIFT messages.,0;;;
Cost Recovery All costs for the design, development, testing and implementation of the automatic Money Market ISIN Issuance system will be recovered from STRATE.,0;;;
In addition, a monthly running cost, covering the cost of administration and maintenance of the data and systems will be recovered from STRATE.,0;;;
The monthly running costs and billing methodology will require definition, by the JSE, in the SLA.,0;;;
Invoicing will be conducted by the JSE's Finance Division.,0;;;

Manage Indigent Defense Services.,0;;;
Software Requirements Specification.,0;;;
The Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) is an initiative being undertaken by Tarrant County, Texas.,0;;;
The vision for IJIS is to define and develop enhanced business processes and supporting technology solutions that result in a more effective and efficient administration of justice in Tarrant County.,0;;;
When complete, IJIS will facilitate rapid sharing of information across the Criminal Justice Community while providing each stakeholder with advanced justice management capabilities.,0;;;
The goal of the current phase of the initiative is to define IJIS business requirements shared by the Criminal Justice Community.,0;;;
To reach agreement on the business requirements, a three-stage approach will be been used: 1.,0;;;
A baseline of use cases has been prepared to provide a starting point for discussions with the Criminal Justice Community.,0;;;
The baseline represents a compilation of requirements identified during review of background materials obtained from various sources.,0;;;
Workshops will be held to collect requirements from the Criminal Justice Community.,0;;;
The baseline requirements, documented here, will be reviewed, and requirements added, removed and refined.,0;;;
The material provided during the workshops will be consolidated into a single model, and reviewed at a final workshop with representatives from the Criminal Justice Community.,0;;;

The approach provides a common ?Ianguage? for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts.,0;;;
This speci?cation does not include the XML schema to be used.,0;;;
No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ?black boxes?.,0;;
The following aspects of procurement are out of scope: 0 Seller discovery.,0;;;
0 on-Iine negotiation and e-auctions.,1;;;
0 e-tendering; 0 negotiation of terms and conditions of trade.,1;;
0 communication with third parties and intermediaries e.g.,1;;;
carriers, banks and fiscal authorities.,0;;;
0 message transport and security.,1;;;
0 data protection and retention rules.,1;;;
0 the application of public sector purchasing policy.,1;;;
eProcurement is a many-to-many electronic data interchange (EDI) problem on a large scale and requires both the sender and the receiver to interpret each and every data element in precisely the same way.,1;;;
In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.,0;;;
This specification is not prescriptive regarding Document variants and, in particular, the business rules that may be required to provide automated support for the provision of copies, revisions and cancellations.,0;;;
These requirements support several Government initiatives, including.,0;;;
0 the generation of value for money efficiency savings.,1;;;
0 the wish from ministerial level for the UK to be the best place to do e-business.,1;;;
0 that 100% of interactions between Government and business be available electronically by 2005.,1;;;
The greatest bene?ts accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re-keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.,1;;;
One example is the ?three-way match? between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.,0;;;
Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer?s back office.,0;;;
Cross?Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).,0;;;
This specification provides a clear ?stake in the ground? for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.,0;;;
Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple specifications.,0;;;
This work has been undertaken within the e-Commerce team in the Of?ce of Government Commerce (OGC), reporting to a joint eProcurement Interoperability Working Group of the OGC and the Office of the e-Envoy (OeE).,1;;;
Aworking group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.,0;;;
These requirements have been re?ned through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.,0;;;
The method used is based on the OeE?s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF); see www.qovtalk.qov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.asp.,0;;
The scope for this speci?cation is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.,0;;;
This broad domain is broken down into four main business processes.,0;;;
Sourcing includes activity prior to placing a formal order, including the exchange of Catalogue information, Requests For Quotation (RFQ) and Quotations.,0;;;
Ordering includes Purchase Orders and responses.,1;;;
Fulfilment includes delivery/despatch noti?cation, receipt (including variances) and Seller's proposed recti?cation of any problems.,0;;;
Accounting includes Invoices (including Self Billed Invoices) Credit Notes, Debit Notes, Statements and Remittance Advice.,1;;;
Each business process involves the exchange of information between the Buyer and the Seller, using a number of Documents.,0;;;
Documents Produced in Each Business Process.,1;;;
Sourcing Request for Quotation Catalogue.,1;;;
Ordering Purchase Order Purchase Order Response.,1;;;
Fulfilment Receipt Advice Ful?lment Notification.,1;;;
Accounting Self Billed Invoice Invoice.,1;;;
Debit Note Credit Note.,1;;;
Remittance Advice Statement.,1;;;
The Documents included are: Catalogue RFQ (Request for Quotation) Quotation is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to provide Item price and other information for use in locally held Catalogues.,0;;;
Is a request from the Buyer to the Seller to quote terms and conditions under which the Seller is willing to supply speci?c goods or services.,0;;;
Variants may support revision or cancellation of the Purchase Order either in content (Items ordered or quantity of Items) and/or in terms of fulfilment (changed delivery details, required by date etc).,1;;;
|t acknowledges that the Purchase Order has been received and that it will be ful?lled in total, in part or not at all.,0;;;
It may also give additional information about specific delivery.,0;;;
The Documents included are: Fulfilment Notification is sent by the Seller to tell the Buyer that goods have been despatched or delivered or that a service has been performed.,1;;;
The Seller may use this Document to notify the Buyer of shipping details via a third party carrier and to notify partial or complete delivery of a Purchase Order.,1;;;
Receipt Advice is sent by the Buyer to the Seller to acknowledge receipt in full or in part and to describe discovered variances e.g.,0;;;
un-noti?ed under?delivery, over?delivery, wrong Items delivered or damaged goods.,0;;;
Rectification Advice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to tell the Buyer of action to be taken regarding the goods or services at variance from the actual requirement e.g.,0;;;
the Seller may ask the Buyer to return the goods, await collection of the goods (by the Seller or his carrier) or destroy the goods.,0;;;
2.1.4 Accounting The Documents included are: Invoice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to request payment for goods delivered or services performed.,1;;;
Invoice is a Value Added Tax (VAT) Document.,0;;;
Self Billed Invoice is an Invoice sent from the Buyer to the Seller where the two have a self billing arrangement.,0;;;
For more information regarding HMCE requirements for self billing, see WWW.hmce.qov.uk/forms/notices/700-62.htm Self Billed Invoice is a VAT Document.,0;;;
Credit Note is sent from the Seller to the Buyer, confirming that the Seller owes money to the Buyer.,0;;;
It may be used to rectify errors and/or variances in the invoicing process.,0;;;
Credit Note is a VAT Document.,0;;;
Debit Note is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, stating that Buyer has deducted amounts from a Seller?s Invoice.,1;;;
A Debit Note precludes the need for a Seller to raise a Credit Note.,1;;;
Debit Note is a VAT Document.,0;;;
Remittance Advice is sent from the Buyer to the Seller, notifying payment and stating what Invoices, Credit and Debit Notes have been accounted for.,1;;;
Statement is sent from the Seller to the Buyer summarising the status of the Buyer?s account and the Invoices, Remittances, Debit and Credit Notes submitted within a speci?c time period.,1;;;
2.2 Parties A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives goods, services or information.,0;;;
A role is a job done by a particular Party.,1;;;
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.,1;;;
Every Document has a sender and receiver, one of which is a Buyer role, the other a Seller role.,0;;;
The Party types, ro|es names and Documents sent and received are shown in Table 2.,0;;;
Seller ro|es include: Sales Point Despatch Point Customer Service Accounts Receivable is responsible for the arrangement and maintenance of trading agreements with suppliers, including Catalogue data.,1;;;
"The Purchasing Manager is not involved in other transactions; if the Purchasing Manager requests or makes a purchase, that individual adopts the role of Originator or Order Point respectively.,1";;;
If Originator subsequently places a Purchase Order, the Originator adopts the role of Order Point.,0;;;
Purchase Card (credit or debit card) information may be associated with the Order Point.,0;;;
It may include Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information i.e.,0;;;
Note: Messages to and from banks are out of scope.,0;;;
2.2.3 Third Party Roles Third Party ro|es include: Carrier is assigned by the Seller or the Buyer to deliver or return goods.,1;;;
Note: Messages to and from carriers are out of scope.,0;;;
2.3 Codes and Identifiers Semantic interoperability depends on the ability of computers to match identi?ers and codes.,0;;;
Identifiers and codes are needed to enable: 0 the Seller to identify the Buyer.,0;;;
commodity classification, and identi?ed at individual or Catalogue |tem level as appropriate.,0;;;
The identi?ers, coding and classification schemes used in this specification fall into five groups: International used and maintained internationally, including: 0 country codes (ISO 3166).,0;;;
0 International Commercial Terms (INCOTERMS - International Chambers of Commerce).,1;;;
0 Units of Measure (UN Recommendation No.,1;;;
National used and maintained nationally, including the OeE Government.,0;;;
Data Standards Catalogue (GDSC).,0;;;
Examples include: 0 Company registration number.,0;;;
Speci?ed in this developed for this speci?cation including: Document 0 Document status 0 payment method Application-speci?c a variety of application-speci?c identification schemes are supported.,0;;;
0 Buyer reference for Seller.,1;;;
0 locally specified identifiers for instances of: o Quotation.,1;;;
0 Purchase Order.,1;;;
0 Fulfilment Notification.,1;;;
Universally Unique Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is an instance identifier Identi?ers generated on the fly as speci?ed in ISO 11587.,0;;;
UUID is a 128 bit string usua||y formatted as 32 characters alphanumeric.,0;;;
In this specification UUID is used for matching instances of Document and Line between Documents and for referring to multiple ro|e instances of the same Party within a single Document.,0;;;
UUIDs provide an effective means to ensure exact matching of identifiers at machine level, but are not well suited to visual matching, which is why existing ID data are also required.,1;;;
Common Elements Each Document is made up of a common set of elements, which are described below.,0;;;
The descriptions are illustrated with UML class diagrams.,0;;;
A specialisation inherits all of the properties of its parent class.,0;;;
Some knowledge of UML is needed to understand the model fully, but the text is intended to be understandable to those who are not familiar with the UML notation.,1;;;
contains information about each Party including organisation and person details, postal and electronic addresses.,0;;;
A sender and a receiver are included in every Document.,1;;;
3.2 Party A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives information, goods or services.,0;;;
A role is a job done by a particular Party.,0;;;
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.,0;;;
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.,0;;;
The full details of any Party only need to be provided once and other occurences of the same Party may be cross-referenced using Party UUID.,1;;;
is the unstructured name of an individual within an organisation.,0;;;
Unstructured name is typically entered manua||y at the time of the transaction.,0;;;
When an unstructured address is used, it must have 1 to 5 Lines.,0;;;
The UK Post Code is a combination of between five and seven letters and numbers which define four different levels of geographic unit.,1;;;
Although Post Code cannot be made mandatory in all circumstances, it should be present if known.,0;;;
This needs to be coded to enable collection of management data on source of imports and exports.,0;;;
For companies registered in England and Wales, this is the company Registration Number issued by Companies House, Cardiff.,0;;;
VAT Identifier includes Country Code (as above) and VAT number.,1;;;
It is a specific Internet identifier that contains a locally interpreted string followed by the ?at? sign (@) followed by an Internet domain.,0;;;
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.,0;;;
The full details of any Party only need to be provided once and other occurences of the same Party may be cross-referenced using Party UUID.,0;;;
(PAON) is the premise number and/or premise name, or where neithe rof these exist it is the name of the organisation in occupation or a description of the addressable object e.g.,1;;;
Where an industrial estate contains streets it is defined as a locality in its own right.,0;;;
UK |nterna| Code is used if the Country Code is GB.,0;;;

PRODUCT CONSTRAINTS 1.1 Purpose of the the Product 1.1.1 Background to the Project Effort The need for a method of visualisation of biological data has been identified.,0;;;
Currently, there are many groups offering many different tools for visualising data.,0;;;
These visualisation tools provide a range from tabular to three-dimensional graphical views.,0;;;
However, a need has been identified for a tool that can display data in a three dimensional environment, which allows the user to investigate the data and easily see various attributes of the data at a glance.,0;;;
A need for the above-mentioned tool has been identified and, there being no applicable tool available, a project to create such a tool was conceptualised.,0;;;
The primary stakeholder (see 1.2.1) has made the case that the tool to be created is of relevance use and there is a real need for it.,0;;;
This need is established through continual use of other similar tools and a continued identification of their shortfalls.,0;;;
1.1.2 Goals of the Product We want to give the user the ability to visualise and investigate their data in a three dimensional environment.,0;;;
The user should have the ability to see (at a glance) the differences of various selected attributes of their data.,1;;;
The overall goal of this product is to provide the users with something that has previously been unavailable.,1;;;
1.2 Client, Customer and other Stakeholders 1.2.1 The Client The client for this product is Dr Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes, a supervisor at the NIMR.,0;;;
Eventually, the client would like to present and make available the product for the benefit of research merit.,1;;;
The client has said that he is solely responsible for approving changes in the scope of the project.,1;;;
1.2.2 The Customer The customer for this product is anyone from the parasitology department at the NIMR, represented here by Dr Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes.,0;;;
Potential customers may include anyone who works in the field of research and would find this product useful.,0;;;
1.3 The Users of the Product People who may use this product; ? Anyone investigating proteins.,0;;
1.4.2 Implementation Environment This section will describe the technological and physical environment that the product will be installed.,1;;;
? The product should run on a minimum of a mid-range personal computer.,1;;;
? The product shall run with the minimum input tools of mouse and keyboard.,1;;;
? The user must have a capability for creating tab-delimited text files.,1;;;
1.4.3 Partner Applications This section will describe some of the applications that are not part of the product, but with which the product will, or may, collaborate.,0;;;
? Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, NT and XP Operating Systems ? Linux and Solaris Operating Systems ? Matlab ? used for some of the pre-product data generations.,1;;;
Matlab can also be used for manipulating the format of the product's required data.,1;;;
? Tomcat/Apache/Ant ? possibly to be used for product deployment 1.4.4 How Long to Develop?,1;;;
The Grid 3D application was originally developed to be included for a scientific paper to be published at some point in March 2005.,0;;;
It was, therefore, essential that the application be ready by then.,0;;;
The motivation for developing the application within this short time frame was to, firstly, included it in the paper, but also to produce an original product in a constantly advancing genre.,0;;;
1.5 Naming Conventions and Definitions This section shall provide a dictionary containing the meaning of all the name used within this requirements specification document.,0;;;
? Biological data ? data of a biological scientific nature generated by some product or process (external to the Grid 3D application).,0;;;
The demonstrator uses the three dimensional view generated by the application to demonstrate one or more properties of the data to any other person.,0;;;
? Grid 3D ? the application for which this document contains the requirements.,0;;;
For a detailed representation of the Grid 3D application, please refer to the Design document.,0;;;
? Identifier ? refers to a user of the Grid 3D application.,0;;;
The identifier use the application to identify different ?points of interest?.,0;;;
For example, a point that is not close to any other point may be of interest.,0;;;
An identifier may become an investigator.,1;;;
? Investigator ? refers to a user of the Grid 3D application.,0;;;
The investigator uses the application in order to find detailed information about specific points.,1;;;
An investigator may originate as an identifier.,0;;;
1.6 Assumptions This section contains a list of assumptions that are to be made by the developers.,0;;;
? The users have the computing skill for basic operation of one of the operating systems documented in 1.4.3.,0;;;
See 3.3 for minimum requirements for the work station.,0;;;
For a description of any of the below-mentioned names, please refer to 1.5.,0;;;
The context diagram above represents the Grid 3D application during the initialisation stages.,0;;;
It is important to differentiate this with the work context for the application in a state of running.,0;;;
The following diagram aims to describe the work context for the application when it is being run by the users (identified above).,0;;;
In the following diagram, the users are grouped as one entity.,0;;;
This is for convenience only and should be thought of as separate entities.,0;;;
However, the work context applies to each of them in the same manner and, therefore, have been grouped to further the simplicity and understandability of the diagram.,0;;;
The purpose of this section is to identify all the business events to which the product responds.,0;;;
This is to identify the logical parts of work that can be used as the basis for discovering the detailed requirements.,0;;;
This section aims to generate some use cases for the Grid 3D application.,0;;;
These shall be generated from the events list contained in 2.1.2.,1;;;
It is hoped that use cases can be given that cover all the events listed in 2.1.2.,1;;;
With this in mind, the use cases will cover more than one event as more than one event can be captured with a single use-case.,0;;;
This section describes the functional requirements for the Grid 3D application.,0;;;
Each functional requirement should have a fit criterion in order to make it possible to test whether the requirement is implemented as specified in the delivered product.,0;;;
? The product shall plot the data points in a scientifically correct manner.,1;;;
? The grid axis should be labelled correctly according to the input from the data file.,1;;;
? Data points should be coloured in accordance to the cluster number (contained in the data file) ? The product should be able to handle up to 2000 data points.,1;;;
? A single click of the mouse over a data point should bring up the name of the data point.,1;;;
? A double-click of the mouse over the data point should cause the application to display all the data point's details.,0;;;
? The product should allow multiple points to clicked so that multiple names can be displayed.,0;;;
? The product should allow the grid to be oriented by the user.,0;;;
Rotation, zoom and move functions should be employed.,0;;;
2.2.2 Data Requirements The use of the Grid 3D application involves the user supplying a data file.,0;;;
This data file contains all the information of the points that are to be plotted.,1;;;
This is the attribute that is to be used as the comparison.,1;;;
? A description for the data point.,0;;;
In order for the grid to reflect the nature of the user's data, the system should allow for the user to specify their own axis.,0;;;
With this in mind, the first row of the data file should contain the column headings.,0;;;
The following table proposes the format for the data file.,0;;;
? The axis should be clearly labelled and easily recognised after the grid has been oriented into a different position.,1;;;
? The application should be coloured so that the screen shots can be printed out clearly (i.e., black on white background).,1;;;
? The application should be intuitive and not require any specialist training.,1;;;
3.2 Performance Requirements This section aims to specify some of the timing and performance constraints to which the product will aim to adhere.,1;;;
? The program should start within 30 seconds ? This depends on the number of data points that are to be plotted.,1;;;
? The interaction with the data points should have a delay of no longer than 2 seconds.,1;;;
? The response to a change in the orientation should be fast enough to avoid interrupting the user's flow of thought.,1;;;
Otherwise known as the Gnome Partition Editor, it is a frontend to the GNU Parted partition editor, and specifically uses its library, libparted, to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables, and perform all the functions it has been designed for.,0;;;
Several optional file system tools provide support for file systems not included in libparted.,0;;;
This document deals with the functions of the 0.6.0?1 version, made available for public testing in 2010?06?19.,0;;;
The software being described in this document has already been developed.,0;;;
The functions and characteristics that will be analysed have already been implemented.,0;;;
This document has to stay updated with any new features that will be added in future versions of the application.,0;;;
Section 4 discusses the external interface requirements, and finally, in section 5, you can find the nonfunctional requirements of the project.,0;;;
Each section is divided in subsections where different matters are discussed. ,0;;;
1.4 Project Scope GParted is one of many programs used for creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking and copying partitions, and the file systems on them.,0;;;
This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing disk space, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).,0;;;
With this you can boot your computer and use the application.,0;;;
With the .zip file, you can create a bootable USB flash drive, and use that instead of the cd.,0;;;
It is one of the best among the many of its kind, supporting more file systems and providing more functions than the rest (Clonezilla, Parted Magic, Parted (backend to GParted), Partition Image, Partition Magic for Windows etc.).,1;;;
It is written in C++ and is based on the Debian GNU/Linux operating system.,1;;;
It is a frontend to the GNU Parted application which was written by the GNU team and supports creating, destroying, resizing, checking, and copying partitions, and the file systems on them, but only through command line.,1;;;
GParted provides the graphical user interface for ease of access.,1;;;
Other programs use the Parted libraries as well, like KDE Partition Manager and Pyparted.,0;;;
Because this is a Linux?based application it relies on some other software in order for it to work.,0;;;
GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables.,0;;;
This includes but is not limited to:,0;;;
This is important, documentation and help files are vital to any project?s completeness. 2.4 Operating Environment GParted is developed on x86 based computers using GNU/Linux.,0;;;
It can be used on other operating systems, such as Windows or Mac OS X, by booting from media containing GParted Live.,1;;;
In other words you will need a Linux operating system for the install version of GParted.,0;;;
The Live version, on which this document is based, needs a basic x86 ?computer, regardless of the operating system, with a CD drive and/or USB port.,0;;;
In general, it does not consume many resources and almost every computer will be able to handle it properly. 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints,0;;;
The program does not support every kind of operation performed in every kind of file system, but it is constantly being updated and more and more actions and file systems will be supported in the future.,1;;;
The table of permitted actions in supported file systems is in section 2.2. GParted does not support logical volume management (LVMэ) at present, although this feature has been requested by many users and may be implemented in a future release.,0;;;
It also must be noted that GParted is not to blame, on most occasions, if a specific operation cannot be performed on a specific file system.,1;;;
It uses a wide variety of third party libraries and tools which perform these operations.,1;;;
GParted is simply a frontend, which brings together all these underlying functions and processes, and presents them in a graphical and accessible way. GParted requires a working Linux environment for it to work.,0;;;
The Live version requires a working CD/DVD drive for it to boot the computer.,0;;;
As every other Linux application, there is a list of dependencies, or a list of packages required for the program to work.,0;;;
In this occasion, they are file system tools.,0;;;
After booting your computer with GParted Live, this is the first screen you see. GParted provides some other modes, other than the first default.,0;;;
These include loading to RAM only, safe graphic settings, and failsafe mode. You can also boot your computer?s operating system (if any) and run RAM tests using Memtest86+.,1;;;
Selecting the first option, advances the application forwards and presents us with the next screen. 3.2 Select Keymap,0;;;
The keymap is the layout of symbols on your keyboard. Different keymaps are supported; this screen gives info about them.,0;;
Selecting the keymap you want, brings you to the language selection menu.,0;;;
A list of a wide variety of supported languages is displayed.,0;;;
You then enter the number that corresponds to the desired language.,0;;;
After that, you are presented with a video mode preference menu.,0;;;
The default value you type is 0, which loads the GParted Live application.,0;;;
On the desktop you can find all the program?s functions.,0;;;
Under that, is a bar which contains the most common functions of the program, which you can perform on the drive (hard disk, USB flash etc.) selected from the drop down menu on the far right.,0;;;
This can be useful if, for example, you plug in a USB flash drive after GParted has booted.,0;;;
Every time you perform an operation, it goes in pending mode.,0;;;
Then, you can undo if you regret your choice, or go ahead and click apply for the changes to happen.,0;;;
Clear all removes every pending operation from the list.,0;;;
You can also undo and apply from the respective buttons on the main functions bar. ,0;;;
3.8 View Device Information You can view the selected device?s information by clicking View?>Device Information.,0;;;
This brings up information about the selected drive on the left side of the GParted main window. ,1;;;
Details like the device?s model, size, heads, sectors, cylinders etc. are shown. ,1;;;
A warning is displayed saying that all of your data will be erased.,1;;;
3.9 Create Partition Table Clicking on Device?>Create Partition Table lets you create the drive?s partition table?.,0;;;
So proceed with caution.,0;;;
A wide variety of partition tables are supported and the default one is ms? dos. ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_table 3.10,1;;;
Create a New Partition To create a new partition, first select the desired hard disk or other device, from the drop down menu on the right.,1;;;
Then you can either click on New from the main functions bar, or go to Partition?>New.,0;;;
A pop up dialog window appears on screen.,0;;;
Here you have various options.,0;;;
First of all, there is a slider which shrinks and moves to either side.,1;;;
This represents the size and position of the partition you will create.,1;;;
You can type in values by hand, or just use the slider.,1;;;
Then, you define the type of the partition (Primary, Logical, Extended) and select the desired file system to format the partition.,1;;;
The list is displayed in the last screenshot.,1;;;
You can also leave the partition unformatted if you wish to and format it later.,0;;;
If you wish to label the partition, GParted lets you do so in this dialog.,0;;;
Press Add and then Apply to create the partition.,0;;;
In this screenshot we have selected this part of the disk as the partition we will create.,0;;;
It is shrunk and sits on the start of the disk.,0;;;
In the same way, it can be larger or smaller, and sit in the end, or anywhere else on the disk. 3.11,0;;;
Delete a Partition Select the partition you want to delete.,1;;;
Then click on Resize/Move from the main functions bar or go to Partition?>Resize/Move.,0;;;
A dialog window appears, with the same slider as in the create partition window.,0;;;
You use it in the same way or type in the numbers in Megabytes directly.,0;;;
"In this screenshot, it appears that the partition spans the whole drive; we want to shrink it and free up the disk space after it, which will then become unallocated space.,0";;;
Press Resize/Move and then Apply. 3.13 Copy Partition Select the partition you would like to copy.,0;;;
This is partition cloning, useful if, for example, you migrate to a larger hard drive and wish to keep your data and operating system (without reformatting). Click on Copy from the main functions bar or go to Partition?>Copy.,1;;;
A dialog window opens.,0;;;
As with Resize/Move, there is a slider.,0;;;
You can leave it at the default setting, which the exact same size of the partition being copied, or you can only slide it up for the pasted partition to take up more (free) space than the copied one.,1;;;
You can also move around the pasted partition, it doesn?t have to be at the start of the unallocated space.,1;;;
Here you see the slider which defaults at the size of the partition to copy, but you can change that if you want.,1;;;
IMPORTANT: You can paste over an existing partition (whether it?s formatted or unformatted).,1;;;
A warning is shown that you will lose all of that partition?s data.,0;;;
So paste with caution.,0;;;
After you have created a partition (regardless of formatting it or not) you can format it to the file system you like.,0;;;
First, select the partition you want to format.,1;;;
Then, click on Partition?>Format to.,1;;;
A list of the supported file systems appears.,0;;;
Click on the desired one and then click on Apply. 3.16 Unmount Partition,0;;;
If you have mounted a partition to a specific mount point, you can unmount it by clicking on Partition?>Unmount.,0;;;
Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Manage Flags, brings up a dialog window with flags and checkboxes. These are functions supported by the partition, like if the partition is bootable, if it is hidden etc.,1;;;
Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Check, sends in pending mode the check and repair partition errors operation.,1;;;
Click on Apply to have the partition?s file system analyzed, checked for errors and repaired if errors are found. 3.19 Label Partition,0;;;
Selecting a partition and then clicking on Partition?>Label, opens a dialog window asking to name your partition.,1;;;
You could also do that when creating the partition, but if you missed it or didn?t want to do it then, you can label your partition from this option.,0;;;
You cannot label every partition, because some file systems don?t support labeling. 3.20,0;;;
Take a Screenshot of the Desktop or an Active Window Clicking on Screenshot on the desktop, opens a dialog window which informs you that after clicking Yes, a cross?pointer appears and you select the window you want to print?screen.,1;;;
When the cross?hair appears, you can click on any active window to take its screenshot, or click somewhere in the desktop?s wallpaper for a general desktop screenshot.,0;;;
A preview of the screenshot is displayed, and a pop?up message informs you that your screenshot has been saved as gparted.jpeg under /root.,0;;;
For saving screenshots to a device, please refer to 3.21. 3.21 Terminal & Mount Partitions and Save Screenshots to a Device,0;;;
Apart from the main GParted window, you can also launch a command line utility by clicking on Terminal.,0;;;
This is useful for more advanced operations, or if some operations cannot be performed in the main GParted window.,0;;;
The supported shell is bash.,0;;;
For example, you can mount a partition to a mount point in the system.,0;;;
This can be done only through Terminal.,0;;;
It is also used for copying your saved screenshots from the system?s virtual drive to a hard disk or USB flash drive.,0;;;
The first option opens Terminal and presents you with a list of packages and libraries installed in GParted.,0;;;
The second option opens resize?windows.txt in Terminal, which shows you some things you should be careful of when resizing Windows XP and Windows Vista partitions.,0;;;
You quit by pressing q. 3.23 Screen Resolution Changer Clicking on Screen resolution brings up a window with monitor resolution options.,0;;;
Here you can select the resolution that best fits your monitor.,0;;;
This is the first screen of the program that the user sees, and the part where most of the operations take place.,0;;;
On the top, there is the menu bar with each option (GParted, Edit, View, Device, Partition) corresponding to a set of actions you can perform on a disk.,0;;;
Under that, is a bar which contains the most common functions of the program.,0;;;
Then the selected drive?s partitions are presented in both graphical and detailed mode. ? Cancel and Apply,0;;;
Every time you try to edit in any way, any partition, a confirmation dialog appears which warns about the potential of data loss.,0;;;
You can either click Cancel or Apply. ? Pasting into an existing partition You can copy a partition, and then paste it on another existing one, whether it is formatted or not.,0;;;
This of course leads to loss of data.,0;;;
If that?s fine, click OK on the warning window that is being displayed. ? Quitting GParted You can exit GParted at any time you wish, by clicking on Exit on the upper left corner of the desktop. You can select Reboot, Shutdown, or Logout.,1;;;
For the GParted Live to run, you will need a PC (regardless of its operating system, it can be Windows or Linux) or Mac, with or without an operating system.,0;;;
Since it is not a resource hungry program, it will run on most systems without a problem.,0;;;
A CD/DVD drive is necessary for the application to boot, or at least one USB port if you plan to use the USB version of GParted Live.,1;;;
However, GParted depends on some libraries and tools for its function.,0;;;
These packages are already pre?included in the .iso image file you downloaded from GParted?s website.,0;;;
Please refer to 2.7 for more details on that matter.,0;;;
Before booting with GParted Live, you have to download the image file and then burn it to a cd.,0;;;
Although network or Internet communication is not obvious, it is available.,0;;;
You can configure your network adapter to work with GParted by typing in the Terminal: dhclient eth0.,1;;;
You can also use the ifconfig and route commands.,1;;;
Please remember to edit /etc/resolve.conf accordingly.,0;;;
This enables you to update and add new packages to GParted.,1;;;
Its functions and features are not computationally intensive.,1;;;
It does not require a powerful processor or graphics card, much RAM, or disk space, for both the install and Live version, and the program loads and runs fairly quick.,1;;;
It is obvious that when you deal with partition changes, you could lose all your data by human or application error.,0;;;
GParted comes with absolute no warranty and cannot be made responsible for any loss of data.,0;;;
 5.3 Security Requirements GParted Live does not deal with any security or privacy issues, as it does not run from within an operating system.,0;;;
Every user has administrator rights and full access which are given from the start of the program, as you are logged in as root.,1;;;
 5.4 Software Quality Attributes The application provides a quite friendly user interface with its operations accessible from the menu bar and the main toolbar.,0;;;

These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements speci?cations, use case documents, or a vision and scope document.,0;;;
Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or ocation.,0;;;
"Consider a CS minor"" section could provide helpful in ormation. Oregon High school students from several schools and classes were interviewed to gain their feedback on version 1 of the Get Real site.,0";;;
Common thelmes elmerged in the need to change/update overall site graphic design and rea peop e. Students who are not generally interested in CS, suggested graphic design changes, more white space, pictures, and easier to navigate pages.,1;;;
This group was much less tolerant of the site than the CS folks had been.,0;;;
"They wanted a site that ?spoke to them"" and felt that if you were not a computer science student, it had very little to offer.,0";;;
The suggestion was very strong that the site be broken into more readable chunks of information.,0;;;
"The term ?walls of text"" appeared several times.,0";;;
The need for more visually attractive information also was a central theme.,0;;;
They wanted color, photos, diagrams, charts, etc.,0;;;
to break up the text and make the site attractive.,0;;;
Many of them commented positively on the spinning globe and satellite menu. Students who are interested in CS and engineering suggested changes in the Real People, Resources, and Colleges sections.,1;;;
Most of them spent their time in the college comparison chart, and in the real people part of the site.,1;;;
Several commented positively on the sections in each person?s story.,0;;;
One example used on the engineergirl.org site uses an interactive table menu for more detailed information, leaving the main pages short and to the point.,0;;;
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience.,0;;;
Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.,0;;;
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the favored user classes from those who are less important to satisfy.,0;;;
> 2.4 Operating Environment The Get Real site runs as an extension of the OUS site e.g. ~getrea|.ous.edu~ Being part of the OUS domain will maximize Google and other search engine hits.,0;;;
The site runs on OSU servers. 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints Constraints for the website include:,0;;;
Space Bandwidth for video streaming Limited availability of Chancellor?s Office resources 2.6 User Documentation,1;;;
There are no user documents. 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies There are no development assumptions or dependencies. 3.,0;;;

The intent of this section is to show recommended curricula for high school students interested in CS and related careers.,0;;;
This page should provide pointers to curricula recommendations from OUS campuses and other university sources.,0;;;
The ACM has recommended curricula for HS CS students. >UO is working on this area, no other campus has recommended HS courses 3.9 Search for additional information (new),0;;;
At least two kinds of searches are needed, 1) internal search of the Get Real site, and 2) external search of CS related outside sites such as OUS campuses, articles on CS etc.,0;;;
Google, for example provides tools for internal and external searches.,0;;;
The Get Real prototype index page ~getrea|.ous.edu/protoindex.htm| has examples of various search engines. 3.10 Professional Organizations (new),1;;;
This feature requires X hours per week of web design resource for editing the URLs to the DSS feed. 3.12 Ask a Grad or Prof ? FAQ (new) Get fast feedback from the Oregon University System on questions asked in a Q and A format.,1;;;
Answers are posted in an FAQ section for all to read.,0;;;
A Grad or Prof BLOG on CS careers would also work here. 3.13 Consider a CS Minor (new) Information for students in medicine, law, business, and other professions to provide students visibility of the high value of having a CS minor.,1;;;
There are no special communication interface requirements 5.,1;;;
Other Nonfunctional Requirements 5.1 Performance Requirements The Get Real site should be hosted on a server that can provide adequate response time.,0;;;
High school students tend to have short attentions spans, so a slow server would not be satisfactory for this application.,0;;;
The current OUS (www.ous.edu) site is a good example of rapid response time. 5.2 Security Requirements gopsyright and other security measures for Get Real should be the same as the U site. 5.3,0;;;
"There is a need to track and evaluate the ?hits? and time spent on the student-focused website over time; and make content, design, and navigation changes as needed based on evaluation of hits.,0";;;
Some to consider are: adaptability, availability, correctness, ?exibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, and usability.,1;;;
 5.3 Software Quality Attributes Web design conventions should be consistent with the standards and conventions used on the OUS site. ,0;;;
Write these to be speci?c, quantitative, and veri?able when possible.,0;;;

One of the design goals for Gemini software is to use as much off?the?shelf software as possible. in an effort to decrease life?cycle costs and maintenance concerns.,1;;;
External software ? any software available to the Gemini system that is not integral to the system.,1;;;
User?supplied data reduction tools.,0;;;
Embedded software that does interface With the Gemini system Via software is considered Gemini software and is subject to the requirements presented in this document.,1;;;
All software Will be maintained under a version control system.,0;;;
This document draws heavily in form and general content from ESO's VLT Software Requirements Speci?cation.,1;;;

Administrators are responsible for high?level functional control of I the Gemini system as an integrated system.,0;;;
They work With other users to determine appropriate observation scheduling changes.,0;;;
It is possible that a particular individual would fall into several of the I categories.,1;;;
it is not unusual for the astronomer to also be the science observer. 2.2 OPERATIONAL LEVELS,1;;;

It is entirely possible for a single user to be accessing the system through several modes simultaneously.,0;;;
who is often concurrently accessing the system through the observer.,0;;;
There are times when an astronomer might be using both observer and monitor modes. 2.4 LOCATIONS OF USERS OF THE SYSTEM Users of the system will be located at one or more facilities.,0;;;
These are referred to in gen? eral as Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities.,0;;;
The Gemini 8m Telescopes enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility are referred to collectively as the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.,1;;;
This is the enclosure housing the telescope.,0;;;
In general such use would be limited to main? tenance and engineering.,0;;;
8m Telescopes Control Facility,0;;;
This is the facility collocated with the enclosure.,1;;;
This is the facility where off duty personnel reside while stationed on the summit.,1;;;
This would be the Hale Pohaku facility on Mauna Kea and Cerro Tololo in Chile (assuming no support facility is constructed on Cerro Pachon).,1;;;

These are super sites.,0;;;
which have direct links to the telescopes Via communications lines.,0;;;
They may or may not be collocated with any administrative organization associated with the Gemini telescopes.,1;;;
These sites have remote operations capability. 2.4.6 Satellite Site Facility,1;;;
These are sites with high bandwidth connections to the super sites.,1;;;
They have remote operations capability but at a reduced level. Will these high bandwidth connections be private or public: or doesn?t it matter?,1;;;
I don?t understand the different between a remote operations facility and a satellite site.,0;;;
Why does the satellite site not just connect directly to the telescope?,0;;;
Although they have remote operations capability.,0;;;

all requirements and modes presented are,0;;;
I intended to be available to all users of the system.,0;;;
It should also be noted that what the system has to guarantee in terms of operations must ful?ll all possible requirements.,0;;;
The available capabilities will have to be adapted to the operational needs both locally and remotely and these decisions can only be taken later in the life of the project.,0;;;
2.5.9.1 ASTRONOMERS AND OBSERVERS De?nition,0;;;
Observing astronomers are the end users of the system.,0;;;
They range greatly in experi? ence from occasional users of the system to very experienced users such as staff I astronomers at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site and service observers. Purpose of work Whatever their level of experience.,1;;;
observing astronomers will wish to concentrate I on the ef?cient acquisition of astronomical data and on?line assessment of data qual? ity.,0;;;
the system must offer to a user an interface which.,0;;;
while ful?lling the various operational requirements in the different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at any required level.,0;;;
‚ Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification ? August 18, 1994 9:39 am AugusT 18, 1994 9:39 am GENERAL DESCRIPTION USER-LEVEL REQ UIREMENTS USERS OF THE SYSTEM,1;;;
Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope is concerned.,0;;;
They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time.,1;;;
The intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to estab? lish a single point of control and responsibility.,1;;;
This would allow the observer to cre? ate an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount.,1;;;
Astronomers are typically given control access to instruments. however. Operation mode Traditional interactive operation shall normally be replaced by operation Via an automatic sequencer.,1;;;
This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing and ?exible scheduling (as de?ned later in Section 2.7 on page 2?12).,0;;;
A certain degree of interaction shall be provided.,0;;;
It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue.,0;;;
e.g. as a result of the quality assessment of previous data.,0;;;
Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation.,0;;;
However each instance of such a function should be examined as a candidate for automation ? such as focussing.,0;;;
The existence of the scheduling queue shall be transparent to the on?site observer during the initial phases of telescope operation.,0;;;
Only after experience has been gained with the system will the existence of the queue become eVident to the on site observer.,0;;;
2.5.9.2 OPERATIONS STAFF De?nition,0;;;
Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes.,1;;;
These users will be very experienced users of the system.,1;;;
They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to adVise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments ef?ciently.,1;;;
They shall also monitor general performance and system safety. Privileges Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance pro? cedures in case of problems.,1;;;
This includes direct control of physical units. However.,1;;;
If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate recon?guration,0;;;
At the present time it is not clear how to handle Visitor instrument requirements in this area.,0;;;
These users will have a deep understanding of the way the Gemini 8m Telescopes software works. Purpose of work; Software development and maintenance staff intervene when there is a major prob? lem to be solved or an upgrade to be installed.,0;;
They also perform system generation and installation of new software packages or new releases.,0;;;
Other parts of the Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode to support integration tests.,0;;;
This means that a number of commands are available which allow the hardware concerned to be tested (test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers. 2.6 OPERATIONAL CONTEXT,1;;;
This section derives directly from Gemini 8m Telescopes program requirements and spec? i?es the operational context.,1;;;
which is a direct consequence of the structure of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system.,0;;;
The Gemini 8m Telescopes operation has to cope with a complex environment produced by: 0 multi?telescope concept 0 multi?instrument context 0,0;;;
Visitor instrument context 0 multi?user context. 2.6.1 Multi-telescope context,0;;;
Although there are two telescopes as part of the Gemini system there are no plans to sup? port concurrent use of them as if they were a single facility.,0;;;
The Gemini 8m Telescopes are thus characterized all the time as in a multi?instru? ment context. Parallel access to all the mounted instruments shall be provided.,1;;;
Feeding two separate instruments Via beam splitters or ?eld splitters and providing separate control nodes is not a requirement.,1;;;
Regardless of the status of an inactive instrument.,0;;;
The requirement to provide for support.,0;;;
Due to the specialized nature of Visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that complete integration into the Gemini environment is either feasible or warranted.,0;;;
In this case a subset of the available functionality must be made available through a standardized interface.,0;;;
The Gemini Telescopes View all instruments as operating as servers.,0;;;
Visitor instruments must be capable of operating in this mode to be adequately supported.,0;;;
It should be the goal of this interface that it be a subset of the existing instrumentation interface (rather than a separate system).,0;;;
At a minimum this interface should support: I 0 acquisition of status information of instrument by other systems 0 capability to enter preprogrammed observing sequences 0 capability to offset the telescope position and focus,1;;;
om AugusT 18, 1994 9:39 am GENERAL DESCRIPTION OPERATIONAL CONTEXT VISlTOR INSTRUMENT CONTEXT,0;;;
Due to the nature of Visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that more complicated function? ality can be supported.,0;;;
In particular coordinated motions of the Gemini system compo? nents with those of the Visitor instrument (other than simple raster scans) will not be supported.,0;;;
This does not mean that more complicated functionality will not be possible for Visitor instruments that require it.,0;;;
Such functionality will not be offered as a standard service but will require a joint effort on the part of Gemini and the Visitor instrument team.,0;;;
As more complicated functionality will be supported Via standardized interfaces for the Gemini instruments.,0;;;
such as coordinated motions.,0;;;
The dif?culty with offering such services as an externally sup? ported standard.,0;;;
It is important that the Visitor instrument interface be stable and long?lived.,1;;;
The support of Visitor instrumentation is made simpler if the Visitor equipment adheres to the Gemini standards.,1;;;
It is much better to establish a subset of Gemini facilities which will be made available to Visitor instruments Via long lived.,1;;;
Visitor requirements outside of these would be handled on an as needed basis.,0;;;
The support of both Gemini and Visitor instruments would bene?t by the provision of a Gemini observatory simulator.,0;;;
The requirements to have instruments operated as single units imply that several user stations will be active at the same time on the Gemini 8m Telescopes.,0;;;
In other words. any subsection of the whole Gemini 8m Telescopes system should be accessible and controllable from any single point (but of course with protection ensuring security and safety).,1;;;
A particularly simple case of multi?use of the system is multi?point monitoring.,0;;;
By this it is meant that.,0;;;
while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Tele? scopes.,0;;;
someone else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and instruments.,0;;;
This will typically be needed by the operation supervisor.,0;;;
All other users wishing to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by Operations and get permission to do so.,0;;;
The multi?point monitoring mode might also be important when certain dif?cult or rare problems occur.,0;;;
when expert adVice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely.,0;;;
Normally executed with the sequencer by providing a computer executable program.,0;;;
in order to make ef?cient use of the Gemini telescope. B .,0;;;
Interactive operation is supported.,0;;;
but always through the Observatory Control System (OCS). C .,0;;;
There is a Visual user interface to the OCS to allow for changes to the Viewing program. D .,0;;;
It is possible to have more than one station participate in the observing.,0;;;
Interactive observing with time allocation for full nights is a ?rst basic requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes.,0;;;
It is therefore an essential requirement that telescope operation is supported by the software in a smooth and very friendly way in this mode. Interaction will normally be Via an automatic sequencer (see Section 2.5.9 on page 2?6).,1;;;
This is clearly a top priority requirement and one which will have to be realized before implementing any other mode.,0;;;
While its requirements include all those given below for service observing. it has the following special requirements.,0;;;
The observing program must be fully automated. requiring very little human interaction during the observation.,0;;;
The means that the Gemini software must include a suf?ciently rich programming environment to make this feasible.,0;;;
this should be a Visu? ally?oriented environment providing a simple.,0;;;
There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer to test observing pro? grams for completeness.,0;;;
This simulator should function within the Virtual telescope environment of the Gemini system. C .,0;;;
All control software must provide support for simulated use within the Virtual telescope. D .,0;;;
There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both within an observing program and across observing programs.,0;;;
This software must consider target positions.,0;;;
weather conditions. and instrument con?gura? tions. August 18, 1994 9:39 am Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification 2 ? 13 2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS Remote operoTions E .,0;;;
There must be software to support the ?exible scheduling.,0;;;
To maximize the use of the available observing time it must be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the currently available instruments.,1;;;
These would be in the form of preprogrammed observing sequences.,1;;;
It should be possible to resort the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front of the queue.,1;;;
This sorting will be based on properties of the individual observing sequences. current site conditions.,1;;;
Thus queue scheduling is a superset of preprogrammed observing. with similar I requirements.,1;;;
As the costs of implementing such a scheduler are currently dif?cult to estimate it may prove necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project.,1;;;
It also covers remote eavesdropping.,0;;;
(There will always be support staff on?site during observations. however.),0;;;
The requirements for supporting remote operations are:,0;;;
All software should be developed to permit remote operations.,1;;;
There should be no conceptual difference between software working on?site and remotely. I B .,0;;;
All observing facilities should work both on?site and off?site.,1;;;
It should be possible to do full operations remotely. C .,1;;;
It must be possible to restrict speci?c operations to speci?c remote sites.,1;;;
For exam? ple.,0;;;
The method used to restrict such operations should be independent of the operations themselves. and dynamic. 2 ? 14 Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification ? August 18, 1994 9:39,0;;;
However. we will take advantage of commercially available protocols such as ISDN. TCP/IP. Internet.,0;;;
The choice of the name remote operations is meant to suggest an entire category of opera? tions.,0;;;
In this sense it is more general than pure remote observing.,0;;;
Despite the obvious limitations introduced by the link bandwidths available at the differ? ent locations.,0;;;
It is only nec? essary that the functionality of the system be transparent.,0;;;
it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system.,0;;;
However the system design should minimize the impact of link bandwidth on transparency. Security of operation shall be considered and might imply different operation levels and privileges at different sites.,1;;;
It is required that the remote operations software be considered from the beginning in the Gemini 8m Telescopes software design.,0;;;
This should reduce the amount of speci?c software needed for remote operations.,0;;;
The philosophy behind this is that.,0;;;
OBSERVING Remote observing means that users shall be able to observe from a remote site such as Cerro Tololo.,0;;;
This possibility has to be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes.,0;;;
The extent to which realistic observing conditions can be reproduced depends.,0;;;
Experience with previous telescopes at other Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification 2 ? 15 2 ? 16 Gemini Software GENERAL DESCRIPTION OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS Remote operoTions observatories shows.,0;;;
It is a requirement for the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation and will complement service observing. making it friendlier for users.,1;;;
Remote monitoring coincides to a large extent with multipoint monitoring.,1;;;
There is no requirement that the remote screen be a duplicate of the local screen.,1;;;
The remote key? board will have no effect on the local user's environment.,0;;;
A remote observer might also need a real?time Video and voice link with the operator in the control room.,0;;;
perhaps using a portable Video camera which the operator can position as necessary.,0;;;
It is assumed this facility is provided entirely by hardware.,0;;;
This might be necessary to back up local users expertise and to help in case of problems.,0;;;
Distributed access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software.,0;;;
A special case of service observing.,0;;;
where a science observer is present on site and the client astronomer is remotely connected. is considered here.,0;;;
The requirements speci?c to service observing are: .,1;;;
The observing program must be automated. requiring little human interaction during the observation.,1;;;
The means that the Gemini software must include a suf?ciently rich pro? gramming environment to make this feasible.,1;;;
This programming environment should be available both to the astronomer.,1;;;
This access may or may not be done concurrently on a shared environment. C .,1;;;
The programming environment should allow for the communication of special notes. instructions. and comments from the astronomer to the observer.,1;;;
The use of this feature would.,1;;;
But interactive observing is perhaps.,0;;;
It will be done on his behalf at a conve? nient moment that is not exactly prede?ned and may be intermixed with programs from other users.,0;;;
Gemini Software Software Requirements Specification 2 ? 17 GENERAL DESCRIPTION,0;;;
OBSERVING SUPPORT Planned Observing Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments.,0;;;
This might typically be a few times (2) per night.,0;;;
when sky conditions change.,0;;;
It requires also that the observing program is so well speci?ed that it can be executed by someone else.,0;;;
For these reasons it can only be applied to the Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been ful?lled and been in operation for a while.,0;;;
which still requires compe? tent monitoring at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or remotely. At the same time.,0;;;
one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra ?exibility of ground?based astronomy.,0;;;
So whichever scheme is adopted to perform automatic sequences.,0;;;
only on error conditions. any time the user is allowed to break a sequence.,0;;;
It will require the use of service and/or remote observing.,0;;;
This can be comple? So?wore Requirements Specification ? August 18, 1994 9:39 om GENERAL DESCRIPTION GENERAL SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS CONTROL INFORMATION FLOW mented by remote monitoring.,0;;;
Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling quickly. exchanging observing programs.,0;;;
This can be achieved only with the help of appropriate scheduling software.,1;;;
which must adVise the operations team on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the various observing programs.,0;;;
Thus ?exible scheduling is a superset of queue scheduling.,0;;;
These requirements apply to the commands and replies between sub?systems (including status information requests and replies).,0;;;
information ?ow to and from on?line databases. and commands and software for the IOCs. 0 Requirements A .,0;;;
The syntax of control ?ow commands is to be consistent across the system.,0;;;
whether accessing workstation software or IOC software.,0;;;
All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands to test operational status. inquiries as to version.,0;;;
The support structure for communicating commands must be reliable.,0;;;

GOG Software Requirements Specification,0;;;
This is the Software Requirement Specification for GOG, which describes in detail the objec- tives of the software simulator and the requirements to be considered on its design and con- struction.,0;;;
It will use error models to provide rapid simulations of large amount of data.,0;;;
The realism of the simulations depends on the realism of the available error models.,0;;;
The schema shown in figure 1 depicts from a high level perspective where GOG will produce its data on the overall current data flow for Gaia:,0;;;
The implementation of the instrumental error models is planned to be a gradual process that will be based on the study of the detailed pixel-level simulated data produced by GIBIS.,0;;;
The simulation of processed data requires models of the calibration errors that will be provided by the CUs in charge of the calibration algorithms development.,0;;;
In order to simulate data at a pre- cise step of the processing, the addition of the calibration errors is planned to be user-selectable.,0;;;
The output format of GOG simulated data will be according to the Interface Control Document for the Gaia Main database (GAIA-C3-SP-ESAC-JH-002 in preparation).,0;;;
Note that some of the steps and options described here will have to be revised when the actual ICD will be available.,0;;;
GOG is expected to be in continuous evolution depending on the availability of the error mod- els.,0;;;
To allow satisfying all the needs to access specific data, GOG will be entirely modular and configurable through an input configuration file.,0;;;
For the source generation, 2 main options will be available:,0;;;
1. Generation of the data from the Universe model of the GaiaSimu library: the user will specify a sky region (e.g. an HTM, square, circle).,1;;;
Note that the relative positions of the sources with each other will not be used by GOG to add overlapping effects, GOG only works source by source.,0;;;
Only the density at the source position could be used to adjust the error models (if they are provided as a function of density).,0;;;
The user can ask for only one typical epoch data or for all the transits of the source.,0;;;
Two main types of noises will be simulated: 1. Instrumental noise: noise that will come from the observation process, e.g. on-board detection and tracking or observation dead-time. 2. Reduction noise:,1;;;
This will depend on the availability of the models.,0;;;
Note that GOG aim will not be to produce raw data but pre-processed data,0;;;
The following requirements have been capture thinking on a GOG generic operational,0;;;
At this stage some spectations for GOG might changed.,0;;;
The main hurdle GOG has, is that the contents of the main database are not fully completed. For this reason the initial versions of Gog will consider the current specifications and will be based on the restrictions described in section 11.,1;;;
On this overview we see GOG as a unique software product.,0;;;
From the high level perspective it can be decomposed on the SADT diagram as follows:,0;;;
FIGURE 2: GOG general i/o context diagram Exploding the central box, looking one level deeper, we could distinguish the following main blocks of execution.,0;;;
The following pictures shows how the problem is depicted. 2.2 Decomposition,0;;;
According to TL-001 a ?Software Product? is composed of several ?Modules?.,0;;;
In this section we describe how the system is logically decomposed and mention the modules which will appear from Sect. 3 onward and how they interact. GOG as a software product can be decomposed in software modules.,0;;;
We have identified the following main conceptual modules,0;;;
This is for high level requirements which apply to all modules.,0;;;
These requirements may be removed from this document and appear in a higher level requirements document for CU2or at the DPC level.,0;;;
That is, it will use as other the other simulators the Gaia Simu library and the Gaia Tools library.,0;;;
For source generation GOG has 2 main options available: Universe Model from GaiaSimu or a Object Input Catalogue GOG has a source by source processing mechanism GOG must consider noise effects.,1;;;
For noise generation those effects should be user- selectable (they can be added or not and the values should be given by users).We classify noises in two groups:,1;;;

These requirements are not limited to any industry sector.,0;;;
The approach provides a common ?Ianguage? for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts.,0;;;
This speci?cation does not include the XML schema to be used.,0;;;
No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ?black boxes?.,0;;
The following aspects of procurement are out of scope: 0 Seller discovery.,0;;;
0 e-tendering; 0 negotiation of terms and conditions of trade.,0;;
0 communication with third parties and intermediaries e.g.,0;;;
carriers, banks and fiscal authorities.,0;;;
0 message transport and security.,0;;;
0 data protection and retention rules.,0;;;
0 the application of public sector purchasing policy.,0;;;
In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.,1;;;
Such an incremental approach demands that all Documents (those adopted earlier and later) represent the same things in a common way.,0;;;
These requirements support several Government initiatives, including.,0;;;
The greatest bene?ts accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re-keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.,1;;;
One example is the ?three-way match? between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.,0;;;
Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer?s back office.,0;;;
Cross?Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).,0;;;
This specification provides a clear ?stake in the ground? for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.,0;;;
Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple specifications.,0;;;
Aworking group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.,0;;;
These requirements have been re?ned through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.,0;;;
The method used is based on the OeE?s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF); see www.qovtalk.qov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.asp.,0;;
The scope for this speci?cation is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.,0;;;

Receipt Advice is sent by the Buyer to the Seller to acknowledge receipt in full or in part and to describe discovered variances e.g.,0;;;
un-noti?ed under?delivery, over?delivery, wrong Items delivered or damaged goods.,0;;;
Rectification Advice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to tell the Buyer of action to be taken regarding the goods or services at variance from the actual requirement e.g.,0;;;
the Seller may ask the Buyer to return the goods, await collection of the goods (by the Seller or his carrier) or destroy the goods.,0;;;
2.1.4 Accounting The Documents included are: Invoice is sent from the Seller to the Buyer to request payment for goods delivered or services performed.,0;;;
Invoice is a Value Added Tax (VAT) Document.,1;;;
Self Billed Invoice is an Invoice sent from the Buyer to the Seller where the two have a self billing arrangement.,0;;;
For more information regarding HMCE requirements for self billing, see WWW.hmce.qov.uk/forms/notices/700-62.htm Self Billed Invoice is a VAT Document.,0;;;
Credit Note is sent from the Seller to the Buyer, confirming that the Seller owes money to the Buyer.,0;;;
It may be used to rectify errors and/or variances in the invoicing process.,0;;;
Credit Note is a VAT Document.,1;;;

2.2 Parties A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives goods, services or information.,0;;;
A role is a job done by a particular Party.,1;;;
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.,0;;;
Every Document has a sender and receiver, one of which is a Buyer role, the other a Seller role.,0;;;
Seller ro|es include: Sales Point Despatch Point Customer Service Accounts Receivable is responsible for the arrangement and maintenance of trading agreements with suppliers, including Catalogue data.,1;;;
"The Purchasing Manager is not involved in other transactions; if the Purchasing Manager requests or makes a purchase, that individual adopts the role of Originator or Order Point respectively.,1";;;
If Originator subsequently places a Purchase Order, the Originator adopts the role of Order Point.,0;;;
Purchase Card (credit or debit card) information may be associated with the Order Point.,0;;;
It may include Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information i.e.,0;;;
Note: Messages to and from banks are out of scope.,0;;;
Note: Messages to and from carriers are out of scope.,0;;;
2.3 Codes and Identifiers Semantic interoperability depends on the ability of computers to match identi?ers and codes.,0;;;
0 Documents and Lines need to be referenced in subsequent transactions in the procurement cycle.,1;;;
0 internal instance identifiers may be used to avoid repetition of the same set of information many times within the same Document e.g.,1;;;
Delivery Point.,0;;;
0 Parties need to be identi?ed for fiscal purposes (VAT No., Company Registration No.,1;;;
0 Documents need to be uniquely identifiable for audit purposes.,1;;;
0 Items are classified for management information e.g.,1;;;
commodity classification, and identi?ed at individual or Catalogue |tem level as appropriate.,0;;;
The identi?ers, coding and classification schemes used in this specification fall into five groups: International used and maintained internationally, including: 0 country codes (ISO 3166).,0;;;
National used and maintained nationally, including the OeE Government.,0;;;
Data Standards Catalogue (GDSC).,0;;;
Examples include: 0 Company registration number.,0;;;
Speci?ed in this developed for this speci?cation including: Document 0 Document status 0 payment method Application-speci?c a variety of application-speci?c identification schemes are supported.,1;;;
These include: 0 Seller reference for Buyer.,0;;;
0 Buyer reference for Seller.,1;;;
0 locally specified identifiers for instances of: o Quotation.,1;;;
Because, such schemes are application-speci?c they can never be relied on to be 100% unique.,0;;;
Universally Unique Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is an instance identifier Identi?ers generated on the fly as speci?ed in ISO 11587.,0;;;
It is also known as a Globally Unique Identi?er (GUID).,0;;;
UUID is a 128 bit string usua||y formatted as 32 characters alphanumeric.,0;;;
In this specification UUID is used for matching instances of Document and Line between Documents and for referring to multiple ro|e instances of the same Party within a single Document.,1;;;
UUIDs provide an effective means to ensure exact matching of identifiers at machine level, but are not well suited to visual matching, which is why existing ID data are also required.,1;;;
The descriptions are illustrated with UML class diagrams.,0;;;
A specialisation inherits all of the properties of its parent class.,0;;;
Some knowledge of UML is needed to understand the model fully, but the text is intended to be understandable to those who are not familiar with the UML notation.,0;;;
contains information about each Party including organisation and person details, postal and electronic addresses.,0;;;
A sender and a receiver are included in every Document.,0;;;
3.2 Party A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives information, goods or services.,0;;;
A role is a job done by a particular Party.,1;;;
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.,1;;;
Figure 2. shows the common elements of Party.,0;;;
Direct Line is a universally unique identifier for an instance of Party.,0;;;
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.,0;;;
The full details of any Party only need to be provided once and other occurences of the same Party may be cross-referenced using Party UUID.,1;;;
Unstructured name is typically entered manua||y at the time of the transaction.,0;;;
Address may be unstructured or structured.,0;;;
When an unstructured address is used, it must have 1 to 5 Lines.,0;;;
The UK Post Code is a combination of between five and seven letters and numbers which define four different levels of geographic unit.,0;;;
Although Post Code cannot be made mandatory in all circumstances, it should be present if known.,0;;;
This needs to be coded to enable collection of management data on source of imports and exports.,0;;;
For companies registered in England and Wales, this is the company Registration Number issued by Companies House, Cardiff.,0;;;
VAT Identifier includes Country Code (as above) and VAT number.,0;;;
It is a specific Internet identifier that contains a locally interpreted string followed by the ?at? sign (@) followed by an Internet domain.,0;;;
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.,0;;;
Where an industrial estate contains streets it is defined as a locality in its own right.,0;;;
UK |nterna| Code is used if the Country Code is GB.,0;;;
"3.2.3 Extended Electronic Address eAddress XE ""URL""eAddress Channel eAddress Use is the number or string of the electronic address or telephone number.,1";;;
3.2.4 Person Structured Name Title Forename Surname Name Suffix Job Title Department Known As is an individual?s address tit|e e.g.,1;;;

3.3 Document Document is the main container for information sent from a sender to a recipient.,0;;;
All Documents have two or more Parties and one or more Lines.,1;;;
A single Line contains information about one |tem.,1;;;
Each Document is identified with a Document identifier, date and status e.g.,0;;;
original, copy or test and includes details of the sender and intended recipient as well as metadata (information about the Document itself).,0;;;
Linkage at the Line level between Documents allows a many-to-many relationship between Documents such as Purchase Order and Invoice.,0;;;
If the original Document is revised, it may keep the original Document ID, but the Document status and UUID will be different.,0;;;
Note: for a copy, revision or cancellation, the Document date is the date of the revised Document, not the original.,0;;;
|f value is ?true?, the Document is intended for test purposes only and does not to constitute a contractual commitment.,0;;;
URI is used to ensure unique naming.,0;;;
This should be the same as the value of the version attribute in the schema element of both the XML message instance and the schema.,0;;;
This identifier is optional, but is recommended to be sent.,1;;;
The format may be manufacturer specific, but could be a UUID.,1;;;
This is used for non-structured header?Ievel Document information, which is intended to be human readable.,0;;;
This information is should be sent if it is known to the sender.,0;;;
This string may include details of the payment trigger event, the period between trigger event and payment and any agreed settlement terms.,0;;;
This does not include delivery terms which may be |tem-speci?c.,0;;;
In an XML Document it is recommended that the Digital Signature be the final element of the payload.,0;;;

Only the main classes and associations are shown, along with the package to which they belong.,0;;;
Full details of each class are shown in Section 3 (Common Elements), organised according to Package.,0;;;
4.1 Catalogue Catalogue is sent by the Sales Point (Seller) to the Purchasing Manager (Buyer) to provide Item price and other information for use in locally held Catalogues.,0;;;
Each Catalogue Line references a single priced Item, which may be associated with a quantity range and date interval.,0;;;
Catalogue is the date/time by which a respose to the RFQ is required.,0;;;
Quotation is sent by the Sales Point (Seller) to Originator (Buyer) to inform the Buyer of the terms and conditions under which the Seller is willing or able to supply goods or services.,1;;;
Quotation is also used as the response Document from the Sales Point (Seller) when the Originator (Buyer) has purchased directly from the Seller?s web site (also known as ?punch out?).,1;;;
Each Quotation Line references a single priced Item, a quantity, Line value and Delivery Point.,1;;;
It may also reference a corresponding RFQ.,1;;;
Quotation is the date up to which the Quotation is valid.,1;;;
Purchase Order is sent by the Order Point (Buyer) to inform the Sales Point (Seller) that the Buyer wishes to purchase goods or services.,1;;;
It is a promise to buy.,1;;;
Variants may support cancellation or revision of the Purchase Order either in content (Items ordered or quantity of Items) and/or in terms of fu|fi|ment (changed delivery details, required by date etc.).,0;;;

XML extensible Markup Language.,1;;;
These requirements are not limited to any industry sector.,0;;;
The approach provides a common ?Ianguage? for describing eProcurement documents that is modular and extensible to specialised business contexts.,0;;;
This speci?cation does not include the XML schema to be used.,0;;;
No assumptions are made (other than good business practice) about how the internal systems at the Buyer and the Seller are designed or work; these systems are treated as ?black boxes?.,0;;
"carriers, banks and fiscal authorities; - message transport and security; - data protection and retention rules; - the application of public sector purchasing policy.,0";;;
eProcurement is a many-to-many electronic data interchange (EDI) problem on a large scale and requires both the sender and the receiver to interpret each and every data element in precisely the same way.,0;;;
In practice, these Documents are likely to be introduced incrementally, starting with one or two Documents, such as Purchase Order and/or Invoice, and adding additional services as required.,0;;;
Such an incremental approach demands that all Documents (those adopted earlier and later) represent the same things in a common way.,0;;;
"0 Note: for a revision, the whole Document may need to be re-issued and manual intervention may be required; ?cancellation? o cancellation of original Document in its entirety.,0";;;
1.2 Benefits These requirements support several Government initiatives, including: .,0;;;
The greatest benefits accrue when information persists through the purchasing cycle without re- keying and with manual intervention only where needed for business reasons.,0;;;
One example is the ?three-way match? between Purchase Order, goods receipt and Invoice, usually performed in the accounts payable function before an Invoice is paid.,0;;;
Automating the three-way match may reduce substantially the end-to-end costs of in the Buyer?s back of?ce.,0;;;
Cross-Government eProcurement standards also benefit Sellers, particularly small to medium- sized enterprises (SMEs).,0;;;
This speci?cation provides a clear ?stake in the ground? for Sellers, for their trade with Government and, potentially, for trade across the private sector.,0;;;
Similarly, a common Government standard reduces the need for software and service providers to cater for multiple speci?cations.,0;;;
A working group compiled the basic requirements with representation from across Government, local authorities and the National Health Service.,0;;;
These requirements have been re?ned through public consultation, meetings with IT suppliers and experts involved in relevant international standards and trade associations.,0;;;
The method used is based on the OeE?s e-Service Development Framework (e-SDF); see www.qovtalk.gov.uk/schemastandards/eservices.as|o.,0;;
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with UML.,0;;;
- classes are colour coded for convenience, with colours indicating the parent Package of each class: 0 Party pink 0 Document cyan 0 Line green 0 Item purple.,1;;;
chapter 3 of this specification covers common classes which are re-used in more than one Document.,0;;;
- chapter 4 covers individual Document speci?cations.,0;;;
For this reason, each Document specification description contains only descriptions of the attributes that are specific to that Document.,0;;;
All other elements are optional, although some may be required to support certain business processes.,0;;;
The scope for this specification is the procurement of goods and services for public sector organisations.,0;;;
Ordering includes Purchase Orders and responses.,0;;;
Ful?lment includes delivery/despatch notification, receipt (including variances) and Seller's proposed rectification of any problems.,0;;;
Accounting includes Invoices (including Self Billed Invoices) Credit Notes, Debit Notes, Statements and Remittance Advice.,0;;;
2.1 Interactions Each business process involves the exchange of information between the Buyer and the Seller, using a number of Documents (see Table 1).,0;;;
RFQ is a request from the Buyer to the Seller to quote terms and conditions (Request for Quotation) under which the Seller is willing to supply specific goods or services.,0;;;
2.1.2 Ordering The Documents included are: Purchase Order is sent by the Buyer to tell the Seller that the sender wishes to purchase goods and/or services.,1;;;
|t acknowledges that the Purchase Order has been received and that it will be fulfilled in total, in part or not at all.,1;;;
It may also give additional information about specific delivery.,1;;;
The Seller may use this Document to notify the Buyer of shipping details via a third party carrier and to notify partial or complete delivery of a Purchase Order.,1;;;
Invoice is a Value Added Tax (VAT) Document.,1;;;
For more information regarding HMCE requirements for self billing, see www.hmce.qov.uk/forms/notices/700-62.htm Self Billed Invoice is a VAT Document.,1;;;
Credit Note is a VAT Document.,1;;;
A Debit Note precludes the need for a Sellerto raise a Credit Note.,1;;;
Debit Note is a VAT Document.,1;;;
2.2 Parties A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives goods, services or information.,0;;;
A role is a job done by a particular Party.,1;;;
One Party may play a number of roles in a Document.,1;;;
Every Document has a sender and receiver, one of which is a Buyer role, the other a Seller role.,0;;;
The Party types, ro|es names and Documents sent and received are shown in Table 2.,0;;;
"The Purchasing Manager is not involved in other transactions; if the Purchasing Manager requests or makes a purchase, that individual adopts the role of Originator or Order Point respectively.,1";;;
Originator also known as requisitioner, has the original demand for each Item of goods and/or services.,0;;;
If Originator subsequently places a Purchase Order, the Originator adopts the role of Order Point.,0;;;
Order Point raises Purchase Order.,0;;;
Purchase Card (credit or debit card) information may be associated with the Order Point.,0;;;
Delivery Point also known as goods inwards, is where the goods or services are delivered and variances in receipt are identified.,0;;;
Accounts Payable also known as accounts payable, is responsible for Invoice processing and payment and, in some circumstances, the issuing of Self Billed Invoices.,0;;;
2.2.2 Seller Roles Seller ro|es include: Sales Point the acceptance of a Purchase Order.,0;;;
Despatch Point performance of services.,1;;;
Accounts Receivable is responsible for invoicing and credit control.,1;;;
It may include Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information i.e.,1;;;
2.2.3 Third Party Roles Third Party ro|es include: Carrier is assigned by the Seller or the Buyer to deliver or return goods.,0;;;
commodity classi?cation, and identi?ed at individual or Catalogue |tem level as appropriate.,1;;;
Examples include: 0 Company registration number .,1;;;

Seller reference for Buyer 0 Buyer reference for Seller locally specified identifiers for instances of: 0 Quotation Purchase Order Ful?lment Notification Invoice other document identifiers .,1;;;
consignment - Item 0 0 0 0 Because, such schemes are application-specific they can never be relied on to be 100% unique.,0;;;
Universally Unique Identi?er (UUID) is an instance identifier generated on the fly as speci?ed in ISO 11587.,0;;;
It is also known as a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).,0;;;
UUID is a 128 bit string usua||y formatted as 32 characters alphanumeric.,0;;;
In this speci?cation UUID is used for matching instances of Document and Line between Documents and for referring to multiple ro|e instances of the same Party within a single Document.,0;;;
UUIDs provide an effective means to ensure exact matching of identi?ers at machine level, but are not well suited to visual matching, which is why existing ID data are also required.,1;;;
Each Document is made up of a common set of elements, which are described below.,0;;;
The descriptions are illustrated with UML class diagrams.,0;;;
A specialisation inherits all of the properties of its parent class.,0;;;
Some knowledge of UML is needed to understand the model fully, but the text is intended to be understandable to those who are not familiar with the UML notation.,1;;;
A sender and a receiver are included in every Document.,0;;;
summary Document Line Package contains information about Document Lines.,0;;;
Every Document has at least one Line.,0;;;
quantified Line 0 priced Line I VAT Line 0 unpriced Line .,0;;;
Catalogue Line - summary Line Item Package Data Types Package -1_ 3.2 Party contains information about products and services and their instances.,0;;;
|tem specialisations include: priced Item 0 priced |tem validity contains the data types, including enumerations for codes defined within this specification.,0;;;
A Party is any person, organisation or computer system that sends or receives information, goods or services.,0;;;
A role is a job done by a particular Party.,0;;;
One Party may play a number of roles in a is a universally unique identi?er for an instance of Party.,0;;;
This may be useful in providing references within a Document to the same Party in several different places.,0;;;
The full details of any PaIty only need to be provided once and other occurences of the same PaIty may be cross-referenced using Party UUID.,0;;;
Unstructured name is typically entered manua||y at the time of the transaction.,0;;;
Address may be unstructured or structured.,0;;;
When an unstructured address is used, it must have 1 to 5 Lines.,0;;;
The UK Post Code is a combination of between five and seven letters and numbers which define four different levels of geographic unit.,0;;;
Although Post Code cannot be made mandatory in all circumstances, it should be present if known.,0;;;
This needs to be coded to enable collection of management data on source of imports and exports.,0;;;
VAT Identifier includes Country Code (as above) and VAT number.,0;;;
It is a speci?c Internet identifier that contains a locally interpreted string followed by the ?at? sign (@) followed by an Internet domain.,0;;;

Purchase Order Number.,0;;;
If the original Document is revised, it may keep the original Document ID, but the Document status and UUID will be different.,0;;;
is the date or date/time assigned to the Document by the sender (using format ? CCYYMMDthmmss which may be truncated from the right e.g.,0;;;
Note: for a copy, revision or cancellation, the Document date is the date of the revised Document, not the original.,0;;;
|f value is ?true?, the Document is intended for test purposes only and does not to constitute a contractual commitment.,0;;;
This should be the same as the value of the version attribute in the schema element of both the XML message instance and the schema.,1;;;
This identifier is optional, but is recommended to be sent.,1;;;
The format may be manufacturer speci?c, but could be a UUID.,1;;;
This is used for non-structured header-Ievel Document information, which is intended to be human readable.,1;;;
This information is should be sent if it is known to the sender.,0;;;
This string may include details of the payment trigger event, the period between trigger event and payment and any agreed settlement terms.,0;;;
This does not include delivery terms which may be |tem-specific.,0;;;
In an XML Document it is recommended that the Digital Signature be the ?nal element of the payload.,0;;;

Data Types and Emunerations -1_ This section describes the structure of each of the 14 Documents introduced in Section 2 (Business Processes) using simplified UML class diagrams.,0;;;
Only the main classes and associations are shown, along with the package to which they belong.,0;;;
Full details of each class are shown in Section 3 (Common Elements), organised according to Package.,0;;;
4.1 Catalogue Catalogue is sent by the Sales Point (Seller) to the Purchasing Manager (Buyer) to provide Item price and other information for use in locally held Catalogues.,0;;;
Each Catalogue Line references a single priced |tem, which may be associated with a quantity range and date interval.,1;;;
Each Line speci?es a Line Quantity and references a single |tem.,1;;;
Each Quotation Line references a single priced |tem, a quantity, Line value and Delivery Point.,1;;;
It may also reference a corresponding RFQ.,0;;;
Buyer wishes to purchase goods or services.,0;;;
It is a promise to buy.,0;;;
Variants may support cancellation or revision of the Purchase Order either in content (Items ordered or quantity of Items) and/or in terms of fulfilment (changed delivery details, required by date etc.).,1;;;
Purchase Order is the currency in which the Buyer wishes the Invoice to be expressed.,0;;;
This is used when the Buyer wishes to be invoiced in a currency other than that used for the Purchase Order.,0;;;
Note: this attribute is required for Seller performance measurement.,0;;;
FOB (Free On Board ? carrier?s responsibility to destination), CIF (Carriage Insured Freight - Seller to insure to destination).,0;;;
4.5 PO Response PO (Purchase Order) Response is sent by the Sales Point (Seller) to inform the Order Point (Buyer) of the intention to supply goods or perform services in response to a Purchase Order.,1;;;
|t acknowledges that the Purchase Order has been received and that it will be fulfilled in total, in part or not at all.,0;;;
PO Response Ful?lment Notification is sent by the Despatch Point (Seller) to inform the Delivery Point (Buyer) that goods have been despatched or delivered or that a service has been performed.,1;;;
The Seller may use this Document to notify the Buyer of shipping details via a third party carrier and to notify partial or complete delivery of an order.,0;;;
Ful?lment Notification is the quantity unit associated with the shipping of the goods; the unit of containment.,0;;
Receipt Advice is sent by the Delivery Point (Buyer) to Customer Service (Seller) acknowledging receipt in full or in part and describing discovered variances e.g.,1;;;
Receipt Advice Actual Delivery Date is the date/time at which goods are actually delivered or a service is performed.,1;;;
Variance Quantity is the difference between the ordered quantity and the delivered quantity.,1;;;
Variance Condition is a description of the variance e.g.,1;;;
short delivery, damaged goods, underperformance of service etc.,0;;;
Proposed Remedy is the Buyer?s suggested solution to the variance.,0;;;
This may be in response to a Receipt Advice that contains variance.,0;;;
For example, the Seller may instruct the Buyer to return the goods, await collection of the goods (by the Seller or his carrier) or destroy the goods.,0;;;
Recti?cation Advice is the Buyer?s cost centre reference (in cases where this has actually been communicated to the Seller).,0;;;

The Quali?cation Methods applied to the software shall include test, demonstration, analysis, and inspection (T, D, A, I).,0;;;
An example of accumulated data is the compilation of data obtained from other quali?cation methods.,0;;;
Examples of the processing of accumulated data are interpretations or extrapolations made from the data.,0;;;
The information / parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention.,0;;;
It will include controls qualifying the processing involved. Business Rule:,0;;;
A narrative description of policies, procedures, or principles within an organization.,0;;;
Business rules can be divided in to four categories: de?nitions, facts, constraints, and derivations. De?nitions are business rules that de?ne entities and attributes.,0;;;
They are the integrity rules that protect the data in the eventual database. Derivations are business rules that materialize a new piece of information (often attribute values) from other pieces of information.,1;;;
For example, a mathematical derivation might specify that you can obtain a person's age by subtracting his or her birth date from the current date.,0;;;
Commit/Rollback: An individual transaction is processed (commit) or discarded (rollback) by the proponent maintainer of the data items involved. Discretionary Access Controls (DAC):,0;;;
A means of restricting access to obj ects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which they belong.,0;;;
The information/parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention.,0;;;
It will include controls qualifying the processing involved. Location Transparency: occurs when the physical location of data is transparent to the applications and users of the database system.,1;;;
Access to an obj ect potentially implies access to the information it contains.,0;;;
It refers to proponency at the source and record level.,0;;;
Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID): A RAID system appears asone very large, reliable disk to the CPU.,0;;;
The main reason for using RAID storage is its reliability.,0;;;
RAID has the same advantages as shadowing and striping at a lower cost.,1;;;
RAID 4 intended to overcome performance penalties of RAID 3 for small transfers.,1;;;
RAID 5 (in which parity over RAID 3 or RAID 4 implementations), and RAID 6 ( in which two parity disks in addition to data disks are used in an attempt to further improve performance).,1;;;
In a RAID 5 implementation, the data is stored as are check sums and other information about the contents of each disk in the array.,1;;;
If one disk is lost, the others can use the check sums and other stored information to recreate the lost data.,0;;;
Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level implementations to improve performance and reliability.,0;;;
RDA de?nes a set of client and server standards and a mapping of SQL commands to these services.,0;;;
Supports queries of spatial data where the selection criteria are de?ned by spatial attributes.,0;;;
APPENDIX A The metadata and procedures are described for the current Information Resource Submittal Package . Metadata and Related Information,0;;;
An XML tag may be described as any obj ect and is easily created by anyone using a text editor.,0;;;
So far, the burgeoning sets of XML tags have created redundancy and irrelevancy, and they lack validity. XML Registry.,0;;;
To ensure interoperability, this registry provides a baseline set of tags developed through coordination and approval among the Community.,0;;;
The Registry allows a user to browse, search, and retrieve data that satisfy your requirements.,0;;;
Document Type De?nition (DTD)) or existing tags, you may submit your proposed tag to a Community of Interest (C01) and provide amplifying information for all to understand the semantics for its proper use.,0;;;
The COE Chief Engineer will approve a single Point of Contact (POC) for a COI to manage the tags within that C01.,0;;;
Please consult the Registry for the most authoritative list of information resources types.) The FCC responsibilities will include the transitioning of information resources from one status to another.,0;;;
Include amplifying info associated with speci?c Tag(s) Zip and attach submission package to e-mail message to: Rules and Convensions. Establishing a new Information Resource.,0;;;
Follow these conventions for creating new information resources for the Registry,0;;;
If the term is well recognized outside its container term, designate it as an element.,0;;;
Example: CTRY_CD, CTRY_NM, CTRY_ABBRD_NM, CTRY_OFF_NM, CTRY_SCP_NT_TX, and CTRY_PSTL_NM are all characteristics (ER?attributes) for the entity CTRY.,0;;;
In the relational world, they are columns within the table ctry, attributes of the entity ctry in er-modeling, and member attributes in obj ect modeling.,0;;;
It would be expected that a submitter would identify them as attributes rather than elements.,0;;;
But if they were identi?ed as attributes of the element ctry, then the additional baggage (other attributes) must be carried, or submitted as separate elements.,0;;;
We wish to limit the proliferation of tags, so we strongly urge folks to use XML_Attributes sparingly. Include descriptive de?nitions AND synonyms for the Information Resource De?nition.,0;;;
At this time such detailed information is unavailable. The Internal Interfaces for the XS SRS are de?ned as interfaces to COE components.,0;;;
In third quarter 2004, ABC Paint will migrate to a new paint numbering scheme.,0;;;
This migration comes at a time that ABC Paint will be adding and discontinuing a number of paints and collections.,0;;;
For ABC Paint customers to remain loyal and happy, we will create an easy to use system, allowing conversion to the new paints and collections.,0;;;
The new system must be in place by the second quarter of 2004, allowing customers the time to adjust to the new scheme before they will not be able to order the discontinued products.,0;;;
The use of the application will be long-term, used for the immediate transition and in the future when previous customers may return for more paint with old-scheme numbers.,0;;;
This stand- alone product includes features to enable ABC Paint to easily and seamlessly include the application in their current website.,0;;;
1.2 Document Conventions Two primary typographical conventions were followed in the generation of this specification paper.,0;;;
First, all acronyms are fully defined in their first use and then identified.,0;;;
They are also redundantly defined in the glossary, Appendix A.,0;;;
Any bold italicized item in the specification is also briefly defined in the Appendix A glossary.,0;;;
You may find it helpful to review the list of documents related to the project as referenced in the references section, section 1.5, of this specification.,0;;;
These readers will find that this document is a product specification only, not a design document.,0;;;
It is recommended that all readers complete the introduction section before continuing onto the other sections.,0;;;
The introduction section that you are now reading provides a broad overview of the entire project and serves as a guide to the other sections.,0;;;
Developers will find sections two, four most useful to them while sections three and five will most likely be paid the most attention by project managers.,0;;;
Sections two and four provide both overall descriptions of the project and the product itself.,0;;;
Sections three and five present an outline of the product interface requirements and other non- functional or performance requirements, which the final product must meet.,0;;;
The project manager will find these requirements most enlightening to peruse, as they will help guide decisions and performance choices throughout the entire product development process.,0;;;
This system must enable a smooth transition to the new paint numbers and scheme.,1;;;
The system will be designed for use as long as the hardware and operating systems specified in this document remain available.,1;;;
The product will be highly accessible to ABC Paint clients and distributors.,1;;;
The product will be highly accessible to ABC Paint clients and distributors.,1;;;
To enable this wide access to the application, the new system will be integrated into the current ABC Paint website.,0;;;
Each main feature of the application will be modularized.,1;;;
Each module will fit on a single webpage.,1;;;
The application will provide a theme and styling mechanism to allow ABC Paint web designers to integrate the application.,0;;;
ABC Paint has made it very clear that they will make trade-offs to retain the benefits of the application being available on the web, retaining high accessibility.,0;;;
The product is a stand-alone web application with a theme mechanism to allow easy integration of the application into the ABC Paint website.,1;;;
The ColorKast solution is a server based application with a web-based clientfor consumer and enterprise access.,1;;;
In some respects, the application is the next generation of the old mechanical, hand-select, palette board system located in paint stores everywhere.,0;;;
All of these will be defined and described later in this same document.,0;;;
The actual user interface will be described in a separate user interface specification whitepaper.,1;;;
All references to performance or specification apply to the application client.,1;;;
Specifications and performance estimates apply to the application server only if explicitly stated.,1;;;
2.2 Product Functions These functions are modularized sub-components of the client application.,0;;;
Each of the functions has a single purpose and can accomplish its mission without the other components.,1;;;
Together, the components function as a stand-alone application.,1;;;
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics ColorKast has identified two user classes for access to the new application.,0;;;
The first user class is default for all users and allows no administrative functionality whatsoever.,1;;;
The second class, the administrative user, is composed of several subclasses for the secure management of access to data and permissions throughout the organization.,1;;;
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 4 Default: This user has access to all functionality of the application except the administrative fu nction.,1;;;
The user data stored by this user is not password protected but is session persistent.,0;;;
Administrative: This user is composed of three subclasses.,0;;;
Level 3, the highest level administrative user has all access, update, add, delete permissions, and can create other administrative users at any level.,1;;;
Level 2, has update, add permissions, and can create administrative users up to Level 2.,1;;;
Level 1, has add permissions and can add administrative users at Level 1 only.,1;;;
2.4 Operating Environment The proposed ColorKast Solution will be implemented in a client/server model.,0;;;
All processing of searches and storing of information will be local to the server.,1;;;
Client: The web-based client is compatible with most operating systems and requires a working installation of Internet Explorer 4.01, Netscape 6.0, or Mozilla 1.0 or later.,0;;;
The client computer should match or exceed the system requirements specified for the web browser intended for use with the client application.,0;;;
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints A few issues limit our choices when implementing a suitable solution for the ABC Paint Project.,0;;;
It is very important that the application be web-based.,0;;;
We understand that in any design choice, precedence should be given to the implementation of a completely web-based client.,1;;;
Wherever possible, the application should retain full usability with a keyboard input device only.,1;;;
This allows an easy transition for employees who are primarily used to keyboard input in current ABC Paint business applications.,0;;;
Finally, a utility should be available to report errors.,0;;;
In all instances, the application should attempt full recovery and report errors automatically to ColorKast without encroaching on the user experience.,0;;;
2.6 User Documentation Documentation for users will be made available in the form of on-line help within the client application itself.,0;;;
An online tutorial will also be made available.,0;;;
2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies ColorKast assumes that any use of the application will occur in an environment with full compliance to this specification.,0;;;
The application will be dependant on third-party databases for storage of paint information and implementation of the color search engine.,1;;;
The databases will give responses to Queries in sub- second time.,1;;;
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 6 3.,0;;;
External Interface Requirements 3.1 User Interfaces The application will have a task-based screen interface for increased usability and workflow pace.,0;;;
The interface will use accelerator keys heavily to allow limited ?keyboard-only? application use.,0;;;
A task-pane will be available in all workflow scenarios to allow easy access to on-line help and next-step options.,0;;;
The navigation options in every screen will be similar to lower or eliminate the application learning curve.,0;;;
Input confirmation and error notification will be consistent throughout the application.,0;;;
A Pointing device will be required for color selection, for example, when matching colors or using the graphical color chooser.,0;;;
3.2 Hardware Interfaces The application is dependent on existing hardware for a display device and for data-entry via a keyboard and Painting device.,0;;;
The new system does not support legacy monochrome displays.,0;;;
The application provides minimal support for client computers without a Painting device.,0;;;
Display dependency: The client computer must have a display device capable of display of 16.7 million colors or greater.,0;;;
Colors displayed on the target client computer will only be accurate when the device is properly calibrated.,0;;;
Keyboard: The keyboard is used to enter and place Paint name and paint number searches.,0;;;
The keyboard also provides ?keyboard-only? application functionality when a Painting device is not available.,0;;;
Pointing device: The Pointing device provides intuitive, fluid control of the application for less sophisticated consumer users, and ease-of-use for the graphical color chooser interface.,1;;;
3.3 Software Interfaces The ColorKast software will interface with other software for storage of paint information, paint collection data, and the matching and translation of paint color values.,0;;;
Interface 1: Connection to database for storage of information for paint number, name, collection, and company.,1;;;
Interface 2: Database connection for color search, matching, and paint number scheme translation.,1;;;
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 7 These connections are implemented on the server.,0;;;
The Web Browser must comply with standards for HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1.,0;;;
HTTP version 1.0 is a well founded and highly supported protocol.,0;;;
The product also indirectly requires some network connection to the internet, over which it may communicate in HTTP.,0;;;
This network connection assumes a physical or wireless connection from the client computer to a consumer Internet Service Provider (ISP) or enterprise environment Local Area Network (LAN).,1;;;
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 8 4.,0;;;
System Features Each feature has a single mission it can complete independently.,0;;;
This feature set is a modularized representation of the stand-alone application.,0;;;
The modularization approach allows for a more robust application with fault tolerance and easy module replacement for security and upgradeability.,0;;;
4.1 Graphical Color Chooser The graphical color chooser will be a pointing device driven intuitive color selection tool.,0;;;
4.1.2 Functional Requirements The color chooser requires the presence of a hardware pointing device.,1;;;
The color translator allows old scheme to new scheme paint number translation, given a paint number, collection and a target collection.,0;;;
4.1.1 Priority High priority.,1;;;
4.1.2 Functional Requirements The color translator requires the presence of the software color search module.,1;;;
4.3 Closest Colors The closest color tool is a special case of the color search engine.,0;;;
4.1.1 Priority High priority 4.1.2 Functional Requirements The closest colors tool requires the presence of the software color search module.,1;;;
These two databases store paint and collection information.,0;;;
4.5 User Color Palette This is a user experience tool.,0;;;
The user color palette tool will store a list of the user?s recent color searches.,1;;;
If the color sample matcher is loaded, the user color palette tool will also store recent uploaded images for matching.,1;;;
The user color matcher only associates this information with a single client based on a persistent client session.,1;;;
This user data will be removed from the server after 30 days.,1;;;
This information is private but not secure.,1;;;
4.6 Administrative Interface The administrative interface allows administrative users to update, add, and delete paint information.,0;;;
Administrative users are also able to add users.,0;;;
Refer to section 2.3 for development and implementation of user classes and access permissions.,0;;;
4.1.1 Priority High priority 4.1.2 Functional Requirements The application administrative interface requires the color space and paint information databases to be present.,1;;;
4.7 Color Sample Matcher The color sample matcher allows the client user to upload images in a common format for matching.,0;;;
The color sample matcher will allow the user to graphically select with a hardware pointing device the color or blended color group they wish to use in a color search.,0;;;
This module is not a requirement of the project.,0;;;
It is included for specification purposes only.,0;;;
4.1.2 Functional Requirements The color sample matcher requires the color search engine moolule to function.,0;;;
The color chooser requires the presence of a hardware pornting devrce.,0;;;
Software Requirements Specification for CS] 79g / ABC Paint Project Page 10 5.,0;;;
Other Nonfunctional Requirements 5.1 Performance Requirements Color searches among the various collections defined by ABC Paint will be processed in sub- second time on the server.,0;;;
Changes to Paint and collection information will occur in ReaI-time, although the actual processing time will vary with respect to the amount of information to be updated, added, or deleted on the server.,1;;;
While performance requirements are transparently defined at the server, ColorKast makes no guarantees as to the speed, completeness, or timeliness of service over the greater internet.,0;;;
Performance of the application will vary on the speed and type of internet access to which the client computer has access.,0;;;
To verify the performance of the application, ColorKast will show the amount of time the server takes to process a request.,0;;;
The time shown will not take into account the transit time of the information over various computer networks.,0;;;
5.2 Safety Requirements Analysis of the proposed product requirements and features has not brought any safety concerns to light.,0;;;
ColorKast recommends that a full legal review of the final product be undertaken prior to any public use of the product or business-wide rollout.,1;;;
This will ensure that ABC Paint is allowed full indemnification of liability.,0;;;
Refer to current state and federal regulations regarding workplace use of keyboard-based products.,0;;;
Experts have concluded that the continued, repetitive use of data-entry and Painting devices leads to injury in almost all circumstances.,1;;;
ColorKast takes no responsibility for injury or resulting damages from the use of these devices.,0;;;
No attempts will be made to secure this information.,0;;;
Information that the product will collect or store, which need access protections include user specified color palettes and their store of access permissions.,1;;;
Most important, the store of access permissions to administrative features and access permissions must be secure.,0;;;
Questions of application correctness come to lig ht with respect to the accurate display of color samples on the target client computer.,0;;;
In the enterprise environment, we can assume that the kiosk or employee computer will have a correctly calibrated display device.,0;;;
To allow calibration of the clientdisplay device is a possible extension of this application, but is not currently included in the specification.,0;;;
ColorKast believes that a typical employee or consumer should be granted default privileges only.,0;;;
A limited number of administrative users should be created to manage the paint data updates.,0;;;
Administrative users can give other users administrative access up to their own access level only.,0;;;
The software product being developed by ColorKast for ABC Paint.,0;;;
A computer or program that can run applications or request application-based services from a server.,1;;;
A group of colors made by the same company, designed by a specific designer, or provided in a separate group from other paints.,1;;;
For example, the Ralph Lauren Collection.,0;;;
A card, list, or other utility for displaying available or selected colors.,0;;;
Logical color numbers used to represent physical colors normally represented as 363 triplets.,0;;;
Hardware, a keyboard or mouse used to interact with an application.,0;;;
An input device, such as a mouse, joystick, or trackball, with which one can move or manipulate a cursor or pointer to interact with an application.,1;;;
Limited security through indirect verification of identity.,0;;;
For example, in the ColorKast application, persistent user data is linked to a specific client session on a client computer, not a single individual.,0;;;
A client?s request for information, generally as a formal request to a database or search engine.,0;;;
This relates to computer systems that update information at the same rate as they receive data.,0;;;
For example, if the time required to update information on the server is five minutes, then a ReaI-time update will take ?ve minutes.,0;;;
A individual is linked directly to their persistent user data using a username and associated pass phrase.,0;;;
This is required for all administrative level access.,0;;;
A computer that processes requests for data and Queries that are elements of the application.,1;;;
Processing for the client or server that occurs only on the server.,1;;;
These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept of Operations (ConOps), in meetings with potential users and participants, and in subsequent documents identified below.,0;;;
These requirements will form the basis for the design verification and validation of the system.,0;;;
The intended audience for this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.,0;;;
This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system.,0;;;
In addition to increasing productivity, it will maximize their RWIS/ESS investments.,0;;;
2) Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose weather forecasting for the protection of life and property.,0;;;
3) Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations will support real-time operational responses to weather.,0;;;
The Clarus Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a multitude of independent data collection systems.,0;;;
Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best practices and the greater weather community.,0;;;
The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.,0;;;
? The first component is the development of the Clarus system ? a network for sharing, quality checking, and exchanging surface environmental data and relevant surface transportation conditions.,0;;;
? The second component is the development of tools (such as decision support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system.,0;;;
? ?Pavement data? in this context includes surface and subsurface data specified in NTCIP 1204 (Ref.,0;;;
The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits to the protection of life and property.,0;;;

The requirements presented in this document represent the high-level and detailed objectives, constraints, and desires for the Clarus system.,0;;;
Each requirement is identified by a unique Clarus-specific identifier to allow the requirement to be referenced in future documents, providing traceability throughout the development process.,1;;;
Each detailed requirement is traced to its parent through its identification number followed by a unique identifier.,0;;;
A requirements document states what must be accomplished to fulfill the vision described in a concept of operations.,0;;;
It does not state how it is to be accomplished.,0;;;
This document describes each requirement and the basis for inclusion of that requirement.,0;;;
The remaining sections of the document contain the requirements for the system.,0;;;
The sections and their content are as follows: Section 2 ? General Description provides a general overview of the entire system.,0;;;
This section describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.,0;;;
Section 3 ? System Architecture provides an overview of the Clarus system?s components and their functions.,0;;;
Specific requirements in the next section are allocated to and organized according to these components.,1;;;
Section 4 ? Specific Requirements contains the requirements developed from reference documentation and stakeholder communications.,0;;;
This section organizes the requirements into categories that facilitate the system development process.,1;;;
2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.,0;;;
This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context.,0;;;
That context and the overall intent of the Clarus program are described in detail in the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref.,0;;;
While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks.,0;;;
Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.,0;;
Each participating weather network?s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality.,0;;;
Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus.,0;;;
The primary recipients of this data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able to receive data if they so chose.,0;;;
The data will be collected from the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be added.,0;;;
When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus.,0;;;
Figure 2 shows the general process as data progresses from collection through publication to service providers.,0;;;
MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a standard interchange format.,1;;;
While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.,0;;;
While the participants may want to access the network through ?a one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations? (Ref.,0;;;
12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system.,0;;;
Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a ?one-stop? portal.,1;;;
The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed.,1;;;
This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus.,0;;;
Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.,0;;;
These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions.,0;;;
The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between themэ.,0;;;
For example, a ?Collector? administers a ?Sensor,? collects ?Observation Data,? provides ?Sensor Metadata,? and receives ?Quality Feedback?.,0;;;
The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.,0;;;
Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.,0;;;
These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref.,0;;;
8) and summarized in Table 1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.,0;;;
The design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the technical limitations of the system architecture.,0;;;
Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and machine-based product generation.,1;;;
The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers.,0;;;
The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.,0;;;
2.3 User Characteristics Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience.,0;;;
Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.,1;;;
The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.,1;;;
This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative.,0;;;
The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system.,0;;;
From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref.,0;;;
7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user?s interface or interaction with Clarus data.,0;;;
The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.,1;;;
The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.,1;;;
The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data.,1;;;
The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community.,1;;;
The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data.,0;;;
Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups.,0;;;
The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus.,0;;;
The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system.,0;;;
The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems.,0;;;
These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer ? the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system.,0;;;
These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system.,0;;;
The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.,0;;;
Figure 6 ? Context Diagram of Clarus User Needs The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.,0;;;
These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community.,1;;;
This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions.,0;;;
These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers.,0;;;
Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.,0;;;
? Transit ? These are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality- controlled data from it.,0;;;
This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.,0;;;
? Rail ? These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.,0;;;
As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.,0;;;
? Archives ? This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors.,0;;;
The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.,0;;;
2.4 General Constraints Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.,0;;;
Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.,1;;;
To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates.,1;;;
An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue.,1;;;
The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the system to expand and add new data sources and end-users.,0;;;
Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system.,0;;;
To maximize system uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of the system.,0;;;
While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.,0;;;
If the Clarus system fails, requestors will need to use their legacy systems.,0;;;
The system will be ?open,? using architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry.,0;;;
The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable.,0;;;
Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards.,0;;;
? Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No.,0;;;
A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to ?critical national security missions.? Future applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.,0;;;
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers.,0;;;
While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources.,1;;;
Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system.,0;;;
Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data.,0;;;
Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers.,0;;;
Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.,1;;;
Several requirements deal with ?regional? needs, without specifying regional boundaries.,0;;;
It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems.,0;;;
It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different (though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks.,0;;;
Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries.,1;;;
Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations.,1;;;
The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.,1;;;
Data in the system database and in published data sets will likely include geo- reference coordinates in decimal longitude, latitude, and elevation.,1;;;
Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).,1;;;
The base assumption regarding ?database tools? is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools.,1;;;
No special database tools will be developed as a part of the Clarus system.,0;;;
Some tools may developed in the future as part of ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.,0;;;
The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this section.,0;;;
Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and flow of information within the Clarus system.,0;;;
A set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information.,0;;;
The particular collector, QED, or EM service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the environmental data.,0;;;
The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service.,0;;;
It is a set of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus.,0;;;
The specific algorithms and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules established through the configuration & administration service.,0;;;
This arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.,0;;;
There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and schedule services.,0;;;
The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service disruption.,0;;;
The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors.,1;;;
The schedule service will also prioritize and respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure 7).,1;;;
The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods.,0;;;
Flagging out-of-range values is one example of a quality rule.,0;;;
Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data.,0;;;
This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process.,0;;;
The QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality and can be continuously delivered.,1;;;
The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users.,1;;;
Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers.,0;;;
Each of these components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a particular data format.,0;;;
The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and program.,0;;;
It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED retrieval schedules.,1;;;
The configuration & administration service manages environ- mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage.,0;;;
Data transactions and system operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user interface as well.,1;;;
The configuration and administration user interface allows administrative users to interact with these functions and supports the manual quality review processes.,0;;;
These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to specific components within the Clarus system.,0;;;
The types of high-level requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces.,1;;;
Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, development, and packaging of environmental data.,0;;;
Figure 8 ? High-Level Requirements Context The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities.,0;;;
The high-level requirements provide a basis for components in system elaboration, and detailed requirements are subsequently tied to specific components.,0;;;
Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements.,0;;;
The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high- level requirements.,0;;;
In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3.,0;;;
? Functional Requirements ? Lists the characteristics that the system must support for each interface.,1;;;
Identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.,0;;;
? Performance Requirements ? Specifies static and dynamic capacity for the number of users, connections, and other performance related factors.,1;;;
? Organizational Requirements ? Includes requirements for policies and procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and institutional requirements to support the system.,1;;;
Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the purpose or content of each column of the requirements table.,0;;;
The matrix includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which have been deferred due to cost or complexity.,1;;;
Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering system.,0;;;
The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the classification and NNN is a unique number.,1;;;
The detailed requirements are identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement and UU is a unique identifier.,1;;;
This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support.,0;;;
It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.,0;;;
The functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific modules listed in Table 4.,0;;;
Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement.,0;;;
Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or component of the Clarus system.,1;;;
Within each table, the high-level requirements show their allocations to particular modules.,1;;;
If the high-level requirement is allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be repeated in the corresponding allocation?s module.,0;;;
These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept of Operations (ConOps), in meetings with potential users and participants, and in subsequent documents identified below.,0;;;
These requirements will form the basis for the design verification and validation of the system.,0;;;
The intended audience for this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.,0;;;
This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system.,0;;;
Clarus is an initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S.,0;;;
DOT) to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations.,0;;;
In addition to increasing productivity, it will maximize their RWIS/ESS investments.,0;;;
2) Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose weather forecasting for the protection of life and property.,0;;;
3) Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations will support real-time operational responses to weather.,0;;;
The Clarus Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a multitude of independent data collection systems.,0;;;
Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best practices and the greater weather community.,0;;;
Surface transportation environmental data collected by the Clarus system will include atmospheric data, pavement data?, and hydrologic (water level) data.,0;;;
The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.,0;;;
? The first component is the development of the Clarus system ? a network for sharing, quality checking, and exchanging surface environmental data and relevant surface transportation conditions.,0;;;
? The second component is the development of tools (such as decision support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system.,0;;;
? ?Pavement data? in this context includes surface and subsurface data specified in NTCIP 1204 (Ref.,0;;;
The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits to the protection of life and property.,0;;;
Data from the Clarus system will have a wide variety of direct and indirect uses.,0;;;

2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general factors that affect the system and its requirements.,0;;;
This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context.,0;;;
12), from which much of the description in this section was derived.,0;;;
2.1 System Perspective The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a ?network of networks? ? much like the Internet ? for surface transportation environmental data.,0;;;
While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks.,1;;;
Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.,1;;
Each participating weather network?s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality.,1;;;
First, the participants will be able to share collected environmental data with Clarus.,1;;;
Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus.,1;;;
The data will be collected from the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be added.,1;;;
When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus.,0;;;
MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a standard interchange format.,1;;;
While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.,0;;;
While the participants may want to access the network through ?a one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations? (Ref.,0;;;
12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system.,0;;;
Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a ?one-stop? portal.,0;;;
The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed.,0;;;
This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus.,0;;;
Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.,0;;;
These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions.,0;;;
The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between themэ.,0;;;
For example, a ?Collector? administers a ?Sensor,? collects ?Observation Data,? provides ?Sensor Metadata,? and receives ?Quality Feedback?.,0;;;
The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.,0;;;
Determining data types will be a significant challenge.,0;;;
Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.,0;;;
These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref.,0;;;
8) and summarized in Table 1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.,0;;;
There is also a period for which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements.,0;;;
Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and machine-based product generation.,0;;;
The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers.,0;;;
The Clarus system design must address how best to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner.,0;;;
The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.,0;;;
? Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as it is transferred from the ESS to the end user.,0;;;
Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.,0;;;
The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.,0;;;
This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative.,0;;;
The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system.,0;;;
From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref.,0;;;
5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation (WIST) (Ref.,1;;;
6), and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref.,1;;;
7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user?s interface or interaction with Clarus data.,1;;;
The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.,1;;;
The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.,0;;;
The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data.,0;;;
The members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community.,0;;;
The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data.,0;;;
Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups.,0;;;
There is an inherent time scale, similar to Figure 4, emanating from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of data through the Clarus system and between the layers.,1;;;
The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus.,0;;;
The diagram also describes the flow of data between the entities and the Clarus system.,0;;;
The data provider organizations maintain data collection systems.,0;;;
These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer ? the primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system.,0;;;
These stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from the Clarus system.,0;;;
The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.,0;;;
Figure 6 ? Context Diagram of Clarus User Needs The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.,0;;;
These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information services for the transportation community.,0;;;
This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions.,0;;;
These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers.,0;;;
Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.,1;;;
This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.,0;;;
? Rail ? These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it.,1;;;
As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.,0;;;
? Weather Service Providers ? These include the weather support services that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic components of the Clarus data.,1;;;
? Archives ? This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors.,1;;;
The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.,0;;;
2.4 General Constraints Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.,0;;;
Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.,0;;;
To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates.,0;;;
An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue.,0;;;
Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment considerations.,0;;;
Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system.,0;;;
While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed.,0;;;
If the Clarus system fails, requestors will need to use their legacy systems.,0;;;
The system will be ?open,? using architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry.,1;;;
The system should be standards based, where national standards are applicable.,1;;;
Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards.,0;;;
? Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No.,1;;;
A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to ?critical national security missions.? Future applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.,0;;;
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers.,0;;;
While the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data sources.,0;;;
Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not justify the cost of operating the system.,0;;;
Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data.,0;;;
Data not collected in a timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers.,0;;;
Assumptions have also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.,0;;;
Accepting data from contributors who cannot provide these tags with the data could seriously complicate the design of the data acquisition interfaces.,0;;;
Several requirements deal with ?regional? needs, without specifying regional boundaries.,0;;;
It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer systems.,1;;;
It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different (though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks.,1;;;
Data consumers will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not by regional boundaries.,1;;;
Consumers will also need to understand that coverage will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing organizations.,0;;;
The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.,0;;;
Clarus timestamps for data in the database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).,0;;;
The base assumption regarding ?database tools? is that the selected data storage software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and configuration and management tools.,1;;;
Some tools may developed in the future as part of ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.,0;;;
The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this section.,0;;;
Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and flow of information within the Clarus system.,0;;;
The collector, QED, and EM services are sets of services because each individual service represents a particular data format interface.,0;;;
A set of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and outgoing environmental information.,0;;;
The particular collector, QED, or EM service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the environmental data.,0;;;
The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service.,0;;;
It is a set of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus.,0;;;
The specific algorithms and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules established through the configuration & administration service.,0;;;
This arrangement supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.,0;;;
There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and schedule services.,0;;;
The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service disruption.,0;;;
The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data from collectors and contributors.,1;;;
The schedule service will also prioritize and respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure 7).,1;;;
The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods.,1;;;
Flagging out-of-range values is one example of a quality rule.,0;;;
Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data.,0;;;
This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process.,0;;;
The QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality and can be continuously delivered.,1;;;
The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users.,1;;;
Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers.,0;;;
Each of these components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a particular data format.,0;;;
The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and program.,0;;;
It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED retrieval schedules.,0;;;
The configuration & administration service manages environ- mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage.,0;;;
Data transactions and system operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user interface as well.,0;;;
These requirements describe the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to specific components within the Clarus system.,0;;;
The high-level requirements in this document are limited to those that can be derived from a context diagram (Figure 8) that pictures the Clarus system as a single functional block with its interfaces.,0;;;
The types of high-level requirements described in this section correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces.,0;;;
Functional requirements describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking, development, and packaging of environmental data.,0;;;
Figure 8 ? High-Level Requirements Context The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for downstream development activities.,0;;;
Conformance to high-level requirements is shown through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements.,0;;;
The entire development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high- level requirements.,0;;;
In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3.,0;;;
? Functional Requirements ? Lists the characteristics that the system must support for each interface.,0;;;
Identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.,0;;;
? Organizational Requirements ? Includes requirements for policies and procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and institutional requirements to support the system.,0;;;
Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the purpose or content of each column of the requirements table.,0;;;
The matrix includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which have been deferred due to cost or complexity.,1;;;
Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering system.,0;;;
The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the classification and NNN is a unique number.,1;;;
The detailed requirements are identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement and UU is a unique identifier.,1;;;
This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support.,0;;;
It also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required.,0;;;
The functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific modules listed in Table 4.,0;;;
Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement.,0;;;
Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or component of the Clarus system.,0;;;
Within each table, the high-level requirements show their allocations to particular modules.,0;;;
If the high-level requirement is allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be repeated in the corresponding allocation?s module.,0;;;
Following the high-level requirement, detailed requirement(s) are shown to create more refined requirements specific to the associated module.,0;;;
